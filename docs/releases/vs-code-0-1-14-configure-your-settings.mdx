> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:44:06 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>As we add features to Pieces for VS Code and it becomes a deeper part of your workflow, it’s even more important to us to make it as customizable as possible. In this release, we’re adding options to limit your notifications and choose how to accept auto-complete suggestions, as well as crushing several bugs.</p><h2 id="9onpj">Configure your settings</h2><h3 id="5ukfq">Choose your notifications</h3><p>Thank you for all of your feedback on our notifications! We agree that they can get noisy. Now, you can select the amount of notifications you see by choosing between “Critical Notifications” or “All Notifications” in the settings menu.</p><p>If you opt for “Critical Notifications,” we’ll only notify you about errors that will prevent you from using Pieces.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="The notifications settings in Pieces for VS Code." src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/630d870e6cc4c328516ab813_ezgif_com-gif-maker58_1a620b0c27797d853fac7b8f288c028e_800.png" /></div></figure><h3 id="4irdm">Choose your auto-complete selection key</h3><p>Auto-completing code from your personal micro-repo is one of our favorite features. To make auto-complete even more tuned to you, you can now choose which key you’d like to use to accept auto-complete suggestions:</p><ol type="1"><li><code>Enter</code> or <code>Tab</code> : hitting either key will accept the suggestion</li><li><code>Tab</code>: only hitting <code>tab</code> will accept the suggestion</li></ol><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="The auto-complete settings in Pieces for VS Code." src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/630d870f6cc4c353f36ab833_ezgif_com-gif-maker59_3e98fb9ce6f2a2d0e81b01d39f596955_800.png" /></div></figure><h2 id="7tap7">Bug Fixes</h2><p>This release also crushes a couple of persistent bugs, including an overly noisy auto-complete error notification.
