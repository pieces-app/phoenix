# We Built one of the Top OCR Tools
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

id="">First released inside our flagship AI-powered code snippet tool, Pieces for Developers, (which is incredibly awesome and gives you superhuman speed when saving, re-using, and sharing snippets), we decided to let Pieces’s code extraction feature shine on its own with its very own web-based utility site.
id=""><a href="http://codefromscreenshot.com/" target="_blank">Codefromscreenshot.com</a> provides a quick way to use code from screenshots. It can even identify the language of the extracted code! We designed this site to be fast, easy-to-use and ad-free. This is the culmination of 6 months of development work on our very own <a href="http://codefromscreenshot.com/" target="_blank">Runtime.dev</a> web APIs and our machine learning team’s intense work to build OCR models that are fine-tuned to interpret technical language (i.e., code) rather than natural language.
id="">You may be wondering:
- Can’t I just embed code?
- Why not use other OCR tools?

## Why are people saving or sending screenshots of code in the first place?
id="">The Pieces dev team constantly shares screenshots of code and error traces. &nbsp;We prefer code screenshots in many cases because they preserve text formatting and hence communicate more than just the text. Look at these two error messages in Slack, and tell me which one communicates why my C++ code won’t compile :)

## Can’t I just embed code?
id="">Developer-focused content creators for publications like Medium may prefer to spend more time developing code and less time formatting it. Medium’s code embedding features are lacking— &nbsp;to get full syntax highlighting, you need to use an external code embedding service. Some content creators opt for screenshots of their work instead, but readers want to copy code and use it without having to reproduce it character-by-character.

## Why did we build our own OCR models rather than use existing OCR tools?
id="">Most available OCR models were developed for plain text extraction from images. We found the models underserved developers whose collections of images and screenshots of code tend to have code-specific punctuation. Common OCR models, which are designed for plain text, miss this punctuation. We painstakingly designed our OCR models for code extraction.
