> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

React is a JavaScript framework that aims to simplify the building of graphical user interfaces. After being developed at Facebook, React was released to the public in 2013. React is now the engine behind several of the most well-known applications, including Instagram, Facebook and countless others. The recommended method to begin developing a new single-page application in React is with **Create React App**, which provides a we​​lcoming learning environment for the technology, but in this article, we’ll look at alternatives to **Create React App **and explore their strengths and weaknesses.

## What is Create React App?
<a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a> (CRA), the official script recommended by the React team, is the best option for launching React applications. The official documentation website states the following:
Create React App is an officially supported platform for creating single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

### Get Started
Run the following command to create a new app using create-react-app in npm:
```
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```
This command creates a React app project inside the folder called ```my-app```.
With the ```npm``` command below, we'll launch a server and start developing our app.

### Pros and Cons of Create React App
- It’s the React team’s official recommendation for bootstrapping React apps.
- It covers all fundamental functionality without additional dependencies.
- It includes a thorough documentation website.
- Create React App provides developer-friendly setup options.
- It is difficult to add custom build configurations.

## Best 4 Alternatives to Create React App

## 1) Create Next App

A wonderful alternative to create React app, <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create Next App</a> is ideal for getting started if the demand is a little more sophisticated, such as with server-side rendering or static site creation. It’s a respectable way to bootstrap a generic SPA with client-side rendering. It is a straightforward CLI tool for starting Next.js applications.

### Get Started
We only need to execute the following command to produce the boilerplate:
```
$ npx create-next-app@latest next-app
```
To start a dev server, we run:

### **Pros and Cons of Create Next App**
- It provides support for a quick refresh and fetch right out-of-the-box.
- It allows server-side rendering through the ```getServerSideProps()``` method.
- There is no optimization for programs that demand continuous data retrieval.
- There is a learning curve related to SSR features.

## 2) React Boilerplate
<a href="https://www.reactboilerplate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Boilerplate</a> is a fantastic Create React App alternative for setting up a project. On its main page, React Boilerplate touts its accessibility through its app even with no network connection and positions itself as the future of fast web apps.

### Get Started
React Boilerplate’s method to set up a new code repository is slightly different, even though the fundamental idea on which the library is constructed is the same as that of others. To begin, we must clone the setup repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git
my-react-boilerplate
```
Run this setup script when entering the cloned repository:
```
$ cd my-react-boilerplate
$ npm run setup
```
Then comes the start script, which starts the development server:
```
$ npm start
```
This brings up the default homepage:

### Pros and Cons of React Boilerplate
- Development is easier with support for contemporary JavaScript features like dynamic imports.
- It offers support for CSS modules and files directly and SCSS using node-sass.
- It has code splitting support with dynamic imports and React Router-based routing support.
- It’s outdated; the repository's most recent commit was in April 2019.
- It is strongly opinionated.
- It has an extremely large package library.

## 3) Vite
<a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite</a> is a relatively new contender in the front end framework tools arena. With the addition of templates that support Vue, React and Preact, Vite is a universal solution to bootstrap applications from a variety of tech stacks and one of the strongest alternatives to Create React App.

### Get Started
To generate the boilerplate, we just need to run the following command:
```
$ npm create vite@latest
```
After providing your “Project name,”  you’ll be prompted to select a framework:

When you choose the React option, a new React project will be created in the directory. We must enter the directory and install the ```vite``` package as a ```dev``` dependency after the repository has been configured:
```
$ cd react-vite
$ npm install
```
Then, execute the following dev script:
```
$ npm run dev
```
This brings up the default UI at  ```127.0.0.1:5173``` or ```localhost:3000``` depending on your Node.js/Vite version.

### Pros and Cons of Vite
- Its primary emphasis is on the developer experience (DX).
- It offers support for React and Typescript.
- Vite enables automatic build optimization.
- It offers support for preprocessors and CSS import with CSS modules.
- It offers support for Wasm and web workers.
- The building process is based on cutting-edge technologies, so it could be challenging to modify as needed.
- Importing SVG files as React Components is impossible without plugins.
- It is mandatory to “Import React” into every JSX file.
- It supports only JSX files for React.

## 4) React Starter Kit
Let's look at<a href="https://firebase.reactstarter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> React Starter Kit</a>, which bills itself as an isomorphic web project boilerplate and one of the strongest Create React App alternatives. Additionally, the React Starter Kit is described as, “very opinionated” on its webpage; this is because it has already chosen our tech stack for us, which consists of Node.js, Express and GraphQL.

### Get Started
We’ll clone the most recent repository in order to serve as the starting point for the boilerplate:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kriasoft/react-firebase-starter.git example```<a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/npm-vs-yarn-how-do-they-compare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install the dependencies with yarn</a> by first moving them into the newly created folder:
```
$ cd example
$ yarn install
```
Also, launch the development server as follows:
```
$ yarn start
```
That gives us the simple boilerplate homepage we have here:

### Pros and Cons of React Starter Kit
- It’s an isomorphic boilerplate that considers the server (Node.js) activities that need to be carried out, such as with SSR.
- React Starter Kit offers support for GraphQL through Apollo.
- It provides recipes for implementing typical use cases.
- It enables Enzyme's React testing and Flow's static type checking.
- It has a large number of dependencies.
- Its package size is extremely large.
- It is very opinionated.
