### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0-0-8-moving-your-snippets-closer-to-your-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">1 | Display Snippets Directly In Your IDE</a>

id="">In January 2022, the Pieces Team came up with a new version of Pieces for VS Code with the goal of making a developer's life easier. This release had a brand-new feature called the ‘Tree View’ in the Visual Studio Code Extension, which allowed saved snippets to be displayed directly in your editor. You could already save snippets using a "Save to Pieces" command prompt or by using keyboard shortcuts, but this release allowed you to hover over the snippet's name in order to preview it. With Tree View, all of the snippets became organized based on their language. To use a saved snippet, you simply had to click on it in the Tree View. This was a big improvement that got lots of users excited about what was coming next!

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0-1-4-code-auto-complete-is-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">2 | Code Auto-Complete</a>

id="">The second major update of the year came in March, with Pieces for VS Code 0.1.4: Code Auto-Complete AND Code Reclassify!

id="">This feature provided intelligent suggestions for code completion from the user's personal Pieces snippet repository as they typed. This made Pieces Auto-Complete the first tool that powers code completion suggestions from personal snippets instead of public repos; an amazing feature to have in early 2022.

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0-1-4-code-auto-complete-is-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">3 | Code Reclassify</a>
id="">Another new feature in March was Code Reclassify. This allowed users to manually reclassify a snippet’s programming language right inside VS Code by right-clicking and selecting "Reclassify." As always, these features were aimed at helping developers maintain their workflow.

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/auto-save-lands-in-pieces-for-vs-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">5 | Core Features of PFD Brought to You in Visual Studio Code</a>
id="">The remaining core features of the Pieces Desktop app were introduced to VS Code in mid-2022. Tree View auto-expansion, auto-saving of snippets, the ability to add tags and related links within your IDE, log in/log out directly in the extension, and an updated settings option with improved success and error messages; all directly in your editor so you didn’t have to use the Pieces Desktop app if you didn’t want to.

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/vs-code-0-1-8-snippet-editing-and-snippet-imports-in-vs-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">6 | Edit Snippets Directly in Visual Studio Code</a>
id="">In May, we updated to VS Code 0.1.8. This version gave you the ability to edit and import snippets directly in VS Code, without the need to open Pieces for Developers.

id="">The Tree View also allowed users to choose how they view their snippets and offered the choice for auto-save to be toggled on or off via settings.

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/vs-code-0-1-10-lightning-fast-snippet-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">7 | Snippet Search in Visual Studio Code</a>
id="">May also saw the advent of VS Code 0.1.10. This update introduced a fast new way to search and insert snippets from the Pieces library without using your mouse. To search, simply press a shortcut (CTRL + K or CMD + K), search for a snippet, and hit Enter.

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/vs-code-0-1-14-configure-your-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">8 | UX Customization</a>
id="">As we crossed the halfway point in 2022, we ramped up our focus on UX. In July, we released Visual Studio Code 0.1.14. This added options to customize the Pieces experience by limiting notifications and choosing how to accept auto-complete suggestions. This gave users the power to choose between "Critical Notifications" or "All Notifications" and select their preferred key for accepting auto-complete suggestions: either Enter or Tab, or only Tab.

### <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0117-gitmore-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="">9 | Git History Directly in PFD</a>
id="">More spooky auto-magical enrichment happened in October. Code snippets were enhanced to include context from Git history such as code authors, commit messages, file names, etc. The Pieces Explorer was also improved with an "About" section where users could access the Pieces Support Center and connect with our community.
