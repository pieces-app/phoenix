## The Best Clipboard History Chrome Extensions
### Clipboard History Pro

id=""><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-history-pro-bes/ajiejmhbejpdgkkigpddefnjmgcbkenk/related?hl=en" target="_blank" id="">Clipboard History Pro</a> is one of the most popular Chrome clipboard history extensions, with more than 100,000 users and a 4.4-star rating (at the time of writing). This extension provides a variety of features, including managing copied entries (add, edit, and delete), organizing entries into favorites and tags, searching through entries, and much more.

id="">Clipboard History Pro has very intuitive UX. As soon as you install the extension, it adds the text you currently have in your clipboard. Then, every time you copy text, it adds the new text to your entries automatically, along with a link to the website you copied it from. This monitoring feature can be disabled if you would like to have more control over what you add to your clipboard history.

id="">It also allows you to export your entries in many formats, including CSV, and to take a screenshot of any page you’re on. Clipboard History Pro provides sync abilities, but only for Pro accounts. If you stick with a free account, your entries will be stored locally in the browser.

### Permanent Clipboard

It has, at the time of this writing, more than 40,000 users and a 4.3-star rating.

id=""><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text-blaze/idgadaccgipmpannjkmfddolnnhmeklj" target="_blank" id="">Text Blaze</a> is not a clipboard history Chrome extension as such, but it provides many related useful features. The Text Blaze Chrome clipboard extension lets you add shortcuts, also called “snippets,” for longer texts.

In addition to viewing them in Chrome, you can also access them from the <a href="https://dashboard.blaze.today/" target="_blank" id="">Text Blaze dashboard</a>.
id="">The extension has a sleek UI and is very easy to use. It aims to save you hours of typing repeated text.

id=""><a href="https://dashboard.blaze.today/" target="_blank" id="">Clipper</a> is not quite as well-known as the other extensions on this list. It has over 5,000 users, and a 4-star rating. This hidden gem provides you with a lot of features to manage your clipboard history.
id="">Clipper requires you to create an account in order to sync your history across different devices. Your entries are also available on the <a href="https://theclipping.co/" target="_blank" id="">Clipper website</a> when you log in.
id="">It has a very simple UI. At the click of a button, you can copy saved entries or send them by email.
id="">This clipboard extension does not monitor your copied text, and as such, doesn’t automatically add it to your history. However, it introduces an action to your right-click context menu to add text selections as an entry, allowing you to easily add an item to your history with a link to its source.
id="">Like other clipboard history Chrome extensions on this list, you can manage your entries by adding, deleting, and editing them. You can also search through them. Unlike other entries, though, Clipper doesn’t provide a way to organize items into hierarchies.
