# Mac Clipboard History: Upgrade Past the Default
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

id="">This is especially important if you’re a developer, as there are plenty of scenarios where you need to use your clipboard:
- Move your code between files
- Copy and share code snippets with your colleagues
id="">Despite being an effortless tool to use, your Mac clipboard history also comes with a lot of limitations. These limitations may be slowing down your productivity as a developer. This article will show you how <a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" id="">Pieces for Developers</a> can revolutionize your clipboard, a tool you didn’t know could get any better.

## Why is Your Mac Clipboard History Limited?
id="">To access your Mac clipboard functionality, use <strong id="">⌘ + C** to copy, then <strong id="">⌘ + V** to paste.
id="">This may be enough for a variety of situations, but it can also be pretty limiting to your productivity. The limitations of the functionality become very evident when you need to paste something you copied an hour ago, but you’ve already overwritten that piece of text by copying something else. Now there’s no way for you to retrieve it. Then you end up going back to find what you initially saved and copying it all over again.
id="">You can access the text you’ve saved on your Mac clipboard; however, the usefulness of this history is limited. The list only contains only the most recent text you copied. This is how to see your clipboard history on your Mac: 

- Then click Show Clipboard

id="">What you’ll see is a simple text file showing only the last thing you copied.

id="">Once you realize how limiting your Mac’s clipboard history can be, you may feel the need for a better solution. One that will allow you to manage everything you’ve copied in an organized way and not worry about overwriting your saves.
id="">There’s an answer to these performance issues— use a <strong id="">clipboard manager**.

## What is a Clipboard Manager?
id="">As a software developer, you’re always copy-pasting snippets of code from various sources. How many snippets of code have you copied from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" id="">Stack Overflow</a> or <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank" id="">CodePen</a>? How many blocks of code do you move from one place to another every single day? How many lines of code do you share with your peers to solve your project challenges?
id="">A Mac clipboard manager is simply a tool to power up all your copy-pasting in a safe, efficient way.
id="">Imagine you copied an important code snippet from Stack Overflow and overwrote it accidentally. Suppose you want to save a block of code and use it again in an hour without having to worry about where you can store it.
id="">Your clipboard manager has you covered. These tools allow you to store, organize, and view your recently copied items, and then use them whenever you need them.

## Pieces for Developers
id="">As a developer, you’ll want to use a clipboard manager that is specifically designed to support your work with code. That’s where <a href="https://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" id="">Pieces for Developers</a> shines. Pieces is the fastest clipboard manager (and more!) for developers, and it comes with a full set of features, including:
- Searching through your snippets in one place, so you’ll never have to review your Notes wondering which snippets you saved and why.

id="">This way, it will be much easier for you to search through all of your important notes and make sense of your daily chaos while bypassing your Mac clipboard history altogether.
id="">If you want to search for a specific bit of code, simply type your desired search in the dedicated search bar at the top of the app.
