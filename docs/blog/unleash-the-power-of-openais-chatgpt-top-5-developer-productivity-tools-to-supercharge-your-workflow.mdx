## 3 | Pieces for Developers + chatGPT Turbo!

<a href="https://code.pieces.app/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pieces for Developers (PFD)  is a comprehensive developer toolset</a> that includes a desktop app, browser extension for Chromium browsers, and IDE plugins for VS Code and JetBrains. These tools assist in the various phases of a developers work-in-progress journey and workflow. Whether they are searching and saving links or code in their browser, managing that code in the desktop app or IDE, PFD streamlines the development process and allows users to manage their workflow with one toolset.
PFD's existing machine learning models enhance the search and share capabilities of their products, but with the chatGPT integration, they are taking it to the next level. ChatGPT is used to improve titles, descriptions, frameworks, language classification, related links, and tag generation, making code more searchable and the contextual metadata more useful. This developer productivity tool will bring advanced machine learning models to your fingertips, elevating your workflow and increasing efficiency.
The metadata captured by PFD— in the desktop application, IDE plugins, and browser extension— provides the developer with information about their code and insights into their development workflow before they know that they need it. This information transfers between tools and developers, leading to major efficiency gains.
PFD is currently in beta and will be commercially available in 2023 with a SaaS model that includes a <a href="https://code.pieces.app/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Basic plan, a Professional plan</a>, and a Pro + Cloud subscription plan.
