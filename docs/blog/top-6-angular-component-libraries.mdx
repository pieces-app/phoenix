This solution comes with tools that let any developer make unique components using popular interfaces and interaction patterns.

Angular Material is one of the best Angular UI component libraries available. It helps to maintain consistency and a smooth user experience across a variety of hardware and operating systems including Windows, Android, MacOS, and Chromium. The components in this collection can be used to create buttons, dialog boxes, bottom sheets, and other elements. Angular Material has roughly 40 parts that can be used to develop feature-rich applications and fully customizable themes.
- It has a built-in, responsive design.
- It uses conventional CSS.
- Button, checkbox, and text field usage in the new version of UI Components is done in accordance with Angular Material design principles.
- It offers specialized features, including swiping, side navigation, cards, toolbar, speed dial, and more.
- It is used to construct web components and is cross-platform.

First, run the command below to create your Angular Material project using the Angular CLI's installation schematic:
```
// Installation for Angular CLI
ng add @angular/material
```

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6390c3143c20ed6b9ff9be67_image2_ca821f0df91f0ebf5125703c247b1ef5_800.png)

Angular developers can use Google Maps services in their Angular apps by using Google Maps’ set of directives and services. Use of Google Maps in Angular was previously challenging due to the library's use of a script tag, which prevented easy access to the type definitions. This resulted in compilation errors. However, using Angular Google Maps directives, it’s simple to create maps, markers, shapes, lines, panes, and so on. Additionally, the library provides an asynchronous method that to check if the Google Maps library has been loaded on a certain web page.
- It can show a chosen latitude and longitude.
- It allows you to specify a route on Google Maps.
- It allows you to add and place markers.
- It shows the location on a map.

You can install Angular Google Maps simply by doing this:
```
//With npm
npm i @angular/google-maps
```
N/B: In production, the Angular Google Maps module sometimes fails to render.
