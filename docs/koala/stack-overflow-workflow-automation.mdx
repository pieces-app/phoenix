## Make Your Dev Tools Work Harder for You üí™

### Advanced Features. Simple Interactions. 
Pieces for Developers holds the fundamental philosophy that developer tools need to not only be helpful, but proactive by design. Our first-in-kind productivity suite optimizes your existing developer tools and eliminates the chaos of context switching so you can take back your time, stop the open tab back-and-forth, and focus your energy on more important tasks, like writing code.

| Experience Pieces' Auto-Magical Enrichment that's powering first-in-kind search, suggestion, and reference workflows. We've seamlessly blended LLMs in the Cloud with Edge-ML that enables Pieces to auto-generate titles, tags, related documentation links, suggested searches, and so much more. | Our new Snippet Transforms take the meaning of code snippets to a whole new level. With just a single click, leverage ChatGPT to do things like improve the readability and performance of a snippet, turn it into boilerplate, or even translate it into a different language or framework. | Meet Global Search - recently launched in our Flagship Desktop App, it's already one of our most beloved features. Leveraging our advanced Edge-ML & Neural Code Search Engine, it's easier than ever to quickly locate, reference, share, and reuse your snippets. Experience a more efficient, focused development workflow with this breakthrough feature. |

## It Doesn't Stop There...
### Streamline Your Entire Workflow

Saving snippets to your personal micro-repository is only one piece of the puzzle. After enriching, transforming, and discovering related snippets in our Desktop App, you can create a shareable link in one click and send it to teammates with all the related context attached. Also, with the power of our <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode"> VS Code</a> and <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets"> JetBrains</a> plugins, you can take code organization to the next level by incorporating key capabilities directly into your IDE.

| ‚ÄúI have tried a few different code snippet tools and websites. Pieces is by far the most straightforward and most accessible. With multiple ways to save snippets (VS Code, Browser extension, etc.) I have been very happy with how Pieces has worked for me.‚Äù | ‚ÄúHonestly 6 million stars‚Ä¶ It is a fantastic extension and software, it makes your life easier by sharing around snippets through one single place.‚Äù | ‚ÄúA lot of pieces I‚Äôve saved are like insurance policies. It's not that I re-use them 400 times; It's more like a defensive mechanism. I'm trying to avoid a 10-minute spiral of trying to find something I lost more than anything else.‚Äù |
