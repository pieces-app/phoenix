Thus, ushering in a revolutionary era of how we work. </p><p>The latest “Market Map” released by investment firm Sequoia Capital, <u><a href=\"https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mapping AI in the Software Development Life Cycle</a></u>, points to “Developer Tools 2.0” as the next generational opportunity. They referenced GitHub’s Copilot as the tool that, “...may be just the opening salvo in AI’s transformation of how software engineers work”.  As a result, a new gold rush is underway. Large tech companies moving to integrate AI capabilities into their existing tools, while startups develop innovative products that leverage AI to boost productivity and eliminate mundane tasks.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"Sequoia Market Map; Developer Tools 2.0.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6426fba5bc392064b273cf87_image_8046e1bc9669f784087c7346ae4e6ebc_800.png\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequoia Market Map</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"cfqhf\">Microsoft’s Integration: All Things AI</h2><p>In a major move, Microsoft recently integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its popular M365 suite. This announcement comes on the heels of Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI just months earlier. To further enhance the productivity of its suite, Microsoft’s subsidiary, GitHub, <u><a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">purchased by Microsoft</a></u> in 2016, introduced Copilot. This is a code completion tool that utilizes the OpenAI Codex. </p><p>The introduction of Copilot has been a resounding success after launching individual and business plans this year. Experts predict that this segment of the business will generate over $1 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2023. This will showcase the value that consumers place on AI-powered tools in their workflow. Encouraged by this success, and seeking to bring the same benefits found by developers to a broader audience, Microsoft has gone on to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/?culture=en-us&amp;country=us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copilot feature throughout its M365 suite</a>. This will signal the company’s commitment to making AI a cornerstone of its products. </p><p>Microsoft’s Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella, has been leading the charge as the company integrates this technology deeply through its tools. At the launch of <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M365 Copilot</a> Nadella said, “Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth”. This is a welcome message to all software users who want to benefit from the productivity gains from AI. He went on to say, “With our new Copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language”.</p><p>We look forward to seeing what Microsoft will do <a href=\"https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">next</a>!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"M365 Copilot screenshot.

The Pieces team strategically built in-house micro-models that perform offline and on-device. This means access to generative AI, even when you aren’t connected to WiFi. This brings additional value to those individuals and organizations who are security conscious, which is virtually everyone these days.  Secure AI served directly on your machine is a massive leap forward in space. </p><p>Pieces for Developers is center stage in the conversation surrounding both Developer Tools 2.0 and generative AI.  The integrations bring generative AI directly to the browser, IDE, GitHub, and collaboration tools. This allows a developer to stay in their workflow throughout their tools. This spring and summer, the Pieces team will attend various events to showcase the suite of AI-powered integrations, as they look to raise additional funding and invest in partnerships, like the Teams integration that is currently in development. Tsavo Knott, the CEO of Pieces for Developers, will join GitHub on April 5 2023, to discuss what’s next for Pieces for Developers and Developer Tools 2.0. The interview will also be shared on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GitHub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub’s YouTube</a> after the live stream. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"Pieces for Developers Desktop Application &amp; VS Code Plugin.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6426fba4bc3920980f73cdc3_screenshot-2023-03-30-at-34812-pm_9c2a85192ea6dcd461d478dcf9f70163_800.jpeg\"></div><figcaption>Pieces for Developers Desktop Application &amp; VS Code Plugin</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"aqbgs\">Google’s AI upgrades to Docs &amp; Gmail with Bard</h2><p>Google has been investing heavily in AI for several years and has recently announced their new language model, Bard. Although, the full capabilities of Bard are still being tested, early signs suggest that it has enormous potential. This means it will likely go head-to-head with OpenAI. Similar to the autocomplete capabilities found in the Microsoft M365 ecosystem, Bard is expected to make it possible for G suite tools like Slides, Docs, Sheets, and G chat to generate presentations, create visualizations of data with just one click, and introduce new features that streamline workflows and enhance productivity. </p><p>Google has also been investing heavily in AI startups. They have put <u><a href=\"https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/google-invests-300m-to-compete-with-chatgpt-claude-by-anthropic-efd0f0e1222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$300 million into Anthropic</a>,</u> the creators of Claude, a LLM looking to compete with ChatGPT. Claude is not yet available to the public, so very few know the true capabilities of AI. Their large valuation, $3 billion after Google’s investment, aligns well with Sequoia’s predictions about the future investment opportunities in generative AI and developer tools 2.0. </p><p>With Bard’s rollout and Google’s investments in startups, Google is demonstrating its commitment to implementing AI to revolutionize the way users work, communicate, and collaborate.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A graphic of Google&#39;s Bard being integrated into Google.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6426fba5bc392027c373cf89_image_f361e6b3ce7b324e115ca26a007e8d17_800.png\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"d7av\">Conclusion + GitHub Event Highlight!</h2><p>The integration of AI into productivity software is changing the way we work for businesses and individuals alike.
