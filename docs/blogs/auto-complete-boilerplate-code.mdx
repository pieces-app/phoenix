# Pieces User Stories: Auto-complete boilerplate code

<p>From developing APIs to streamlining internal ops to building micro-utilities, Full Stack Engineer Brandon’s work is different every day. The ways he uses Pieces are similarly varied.<p.new.line><p>One feature that he started using recently is auto-complete. “Auto-complete was pretty useful on some of the boilerplate code that I use in my C++ and CMake projects, where I copy certain things a lot and there's not really a good way to abstract it out. So, Pieces auto-completed it and nearly took care of everything for me.”<p.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ac931ab29adf036c3e43c5_snippet1.png" loading="lazy"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p>The snippet Brandon uses across all of his C++ projects to bring in Catch2, a popular open-source testing framework.<p.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ac9323ada93b6976dc0ee8_snippet2.png" loading="lazy"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p>A lot of developers prefer writing code over the more “menial” chores like documenting their code and writing unit tests. Unit tests are extraordinarily powerful when combined with test automation + CI/CD systems, and go a long way to improve software stability. But the caveat is that you have to actually write your tests! “I save these two snippets in Pieces so I can use auto-complete to write tests faster and sleep better at night knowing I’ve tested the code I put into production.”<p.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ac932f5cdc4df9266d1e09_snippet3.png" loading="lazy"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ac933853a39a605a6b7fcd_snippet4.png" loading="lazy"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p>Then, onto the next task! “A typical challenge for budding javascript developers is how to perfo
