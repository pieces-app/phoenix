It brings new features, including the ability to integrate with libraries written in Objective-C and Swift. This means that Dart code can now call libraries written in these popular languages, which are commonly used in macOS and iOS. The FFIGen tool can be used to generate bindings for Objective-C and Swift</p><p>We will cover briefly:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>What’s FFIGen</li><li>What’s new in FFIGen</li><li>Dart CLI App and integrate objective-c based libraries</li><li>Testing FFIGen</li></ol><h2 id=\"budi7\">What is FFIGen?</h2><p>Before explaining the answer to this question, you need to know about FFI (Foreign Function Interface).</p><h3 id=\"ekbag\"><strong>FFI Programming explained</strong></h3><p>FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface and allows one programming language to work with libraries written in another language. It&#x27;s a common technique used by many programming languages, including Java, which refers to it as <u><a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?JavaNativeInterface\">JavaNativeInterface</a></u>. FFI was originally created in <u><a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?CommonLisp\">CommonLisp</a></u> but can be used in any language.</p><p>When a low-level language is referred to as the &quot;<strong>host</strong>&quot; language and a high-level language is referred to as the &quot;<strong>guest</strong>&quot; language, communication between them is established as follows:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>The host language must create a bridge for communication with the guest language by writing functions that the guest language can call.</li><li>An API is provided for the host language to connect with guests.</li><li>A tool that doesn&#x27;t belong to either language is used to build the bridge.</li><li>The guest language is also responsible for bridging the gap with the host language. The guest can call any function in the host language, but must have support for low-level features to communicate effectively.</li></ol><p>According to Wikipedia, these are the things to consider for FFI:</p><ul><li>If one language supports garbage collection (GC) and the other does not, care must be taken that the non-GC language code does nothing to cause GC in the other to fail.</li><li>Complicated or non-trivial objects or datatypes may be difficult to map from one environment to another.</li><li>One or both languages may be running on a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine\"> <u>virtual machine</u></a> (VM); moreover, if both are, these will probably be different VMs.</li></ul><p>Dart has a library called &quot;dart:ffi&quot; that enables using FFI (Foreign Function Interface). Starting from Dart version 2.12, FFI is available in the stable channel. This allows you to use existing code in C libraries, giving you the benefits of both portability and the performance of highly optimized C code. With FFI Programming, you&#x27;re not limited to just C, as you can also write code in other languages like Go or Rust, as long as it&#x27;s compiled to a C library.</p><p><u><a href=\"https://medium.com/dartlang/announcing-dart-2-12-499a6e689c87\">Dart FFI</a></u> can also be used when a Flutter app requires more control over memory management and garbage collection. For example, this could be useful for an app using TensorFlow.</p><p>Dart ffi is used to read, write, allocate and deallocate native memory. There are some packages that already use this feature:</p><ul><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker\">file_picker</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/printing\">printing</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/win32\">win32</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox\">objectbox</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/realm\">realm</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/isar\">isar</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter\">tflite_flutter</a></u></li><li><u><a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/dbus\">dbus</a></u></li></ul><h3 id=\"bv6da\">FFI Programming: <strong>Ways to use Dart FFI</strong></h3><p>There are times when you want to create your own fresh library, but more often, the library already exists (created by some other team) and you simply want to use it. In either case, we have the following choices:</p><ul><li>Manually creating the FFI bindings</li><li>Automatically generating the FFI bindings</li></ul><p>If you like automation, you probably chose the second option. As a result, we have<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen\"> <u>package:ffigen</u></a></p><p>The &quot;package:ffigen&quot; is created to save time when integrating large APIs with C code. Writing Dart bindings for these APIs can be very time-consuming. The Dart team created a binding generator, called &quot;ffigen,&quot; which automatically generates FFI wrappers from C header files.</p><p>Under the hood, this package uses<a href=\"https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/whats-llvm-4c0c3ed43a72\"> <u>LLVM</u></a> and LibClang to parse C header files. To install LLVM inside macOS, run:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"brew install llvm command for terminal to install LLVM on macOS\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/637e8a6d159139b2aa9cd881_image8_e1950f8c97b57475c401bd6c54716a14_800.png\"></div><figcaption>FFI Programming: Brew Install llvm</figcaption></figure><p><u><a href=\"https://aseem.pieces.cloud/?p=7ee847aecb\">Save to Pieces</a></u></p><p>There are multiple types provided by dart:ffi for representing the types in C. However, they broadly are classified by:</p><ul><li>Instantiable Native Types</li><li>Purely Marker Native Types</li></ul><p><u>Instantiable Native Types:</u> In Dart code, you can create instances of arrays, pointers, structs, and unions, or their subtypes.</p><p><u>Purely Marker Native Types:</u> Platform agnostic types like Bool, Double, Int64, Int32 cannot be created in Dart code.</p><p>There are also<a href=\"https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-ffi/Abi-class.html\"> <u>ABI</u></a> marker types that extend AbiSpecificInteger, like Size Short, etc.</p><p>So, we’ve explained <strong>FFI</strong> and <strong>ffigen</strong>— let’s explore what’s new in ffigen in Dart 2.18.</p><h2 id=\"ab8ho\">FFI Programming: What’s new in FFI Gen</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"Dart 2.18 announcement banner explaining benefits like ObjC &amp; Swift interop, platform-specific http and a roadmap.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/637e8a6e15913916779cd895_image23_33ca671085291684a39ed958d46518ba_800.png\"></div></figure><p>The Dart team wants Dart to support interoperability with all the primary languages on the platforms where Dart runs.</p><p>As of<a href=\"https://dart.dev/guides/language/evolution#dart-218\"> <u>Dart 2.18</u></a>, Dart code can now call Objective-C and Swift code since these are used for writing APIs for macOS and IOS. This interop mechanism supports across all types of apps from CLI apps to backend apps to Flutter code.</p><p>This feature is not limited to command-line apps. Even Dart mobile and server apps running on the<a href=\"https://dart.dev/overview#platform\"> <u>Dart Native platform</u></a>, on macOS, or on iOS can use dart:ffi.</p><p>This unlocks many possibilities since before 2.18, it was only possible to call the C/C++based libraries.</p><p>According to the official blog:</p><p>This new mechanism utilizes the fact that Objective-C and Swift code can be exposed as C code based on API bindings. The Dart API wrapper generation tool,<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen\"> <u>ffigen</u></a>, can create these bindings from API headers.</p><p>This support for Objective-C and Swift is marked as experimental starting from Dart 2.18. If you experience any problems, you can comment on the<a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/49673\"> <u>feedback issue</u></a> on GitHub.</p><h2 id=\"ajh82\">Dart CLI App with Objective-C-based libraries</h2><p>In this section, we will create a Dart-based command line application that demonstrates how to call an Objective-C-based library using the new functionalities from ffigen.</p><p>We will choose any objective c library present inside the macOS, and integrate it inside the Dart CLI App.</p><p>One such library is<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlcache\"> <u>NSURLCache</u></a>.</p><p>macOS has an API for querying URL cache information exposed by the<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlcache\"> <u>NSURLCache</u></a> class.</p><p>The NSURLCache implements the caching of responses to URL load requests by mapping<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlrequest\"> <u>NSURLRequest</u></a> objects to<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscachedurlresponse\"> <u>NSCachedURLResponse</u></a> objects. It provides a composite in-memory and on-disk cache, and lets you manipulate the sizes of both the in-memory and on-disk portions.</p><p>We will be integrating the NSURLCache inside Dart and call some of its functions:</p><ul><li>currentDiskUsage : The current size of the on-disk cache, in bytes.</li><li>diskCapacity : The capacity of the on-disk cache, in bytes.</li><li>memoryCapacity : The capacity of the in-memory cache, in bytes.</li></ul><h2 id=\"crlrd\"><strong>Creating a Dart CLI App</strong></h2><p>We’ll start by creating the Dart CLI App using the below command.

Since the library we are using is an internal library, the dylib points to the macOS’s framework dylib. We can consider this library to be dynamically linked.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img alt=\"A Dart FFI flowchart.\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/637e8a6d159139bde29cd88b_image2_9be660206aad748c72e1af70b8cf2448_800.png\"></div><figcaption>FFI Programming</figcaption></figure><p>Note: We can use our own library or a static library (linked inside our app).</p><p><strong>Dynamic Linking</strong>: In this type, the external libraries are placed inside the final executable; however, the actual linking happens at the run time. In dynamic linking, only one copy of the shared library is kept inside the memory which <strong>reduces the program size, memory, and disk space</strong>. Since the libraries are shared, <strong>dynamic linking programs are slower</strong> in comparison to static linking programs.</p><p>A dynamically linked library is distributed in a separate file or folder within the app and loaded on demand. A dynamically linked library can be loaded into Dart via DynamicLibrary.open.</p><p><strong>Static Linking</strong>: In this type, modules are copied inside the program before creating the final executable. Since these programs include libraries, they are <strong>large in size</strong>. However, because the libraries are already compiled, these programs are <strong>faster than dynamically linked programs</strong>.</p><p>A statically linked library is embedded into the app’s executable image and loaded when the app starts. Symbols from a statically linked library can be loaded using DynamicLibrary.executable or DynamicLibrary.process.</p><p><strong>Next</strong>, we construct the URLCacheLibrary by using the constructor which needs the dylib path. For this, we call DynamicLibrary.open. This loads the library file and provides access to its symbols.</p><p>Note: This process loads the library into the DartVM only once, regardless of the function calls.</p><p>Once the library gets initialized, we can call the different methods present inside it (which were generated).</p><p>We are looking for a NSURLCache class.

The Dart wrapper object retains a reference to the Objective-C object, and when the Dart object is garbage collected, the generated code automatically releases that reference using a<a href=\"https://api.dart.dev/dart-ffi/NativeFinalizer-class.html\"> <u>NativeFinalizer</u></a>.</p><h3 id=\"6v0r8\"><strong>Limitations of Objective-C Interoperability </strong></h3><p>The current issues with multithreading are a limitation to Dart’s experimental support for Objective-C interop. However, these limitations are not intentional, but due to the relationship between the Dart isolates and OS threads and how Apple handles multithreading.</p><ul><li>While FFI Gen supports converting Dart functions to Objective-C blocks, most Apple APIs don’t guarantee on which thread a callback will run.</li><li>Dart isolates are not the same as threads. Isolates run on threads but aren’t guaranteed to run on any particular thread. The VM can change which thread an isolate is running on without warning.</li><li>Apple APIs are not<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/ThreadSafetySummary/ThreadSafetySummary.html\"> <u>thread-safe</u></a>.</li></ul><p>Since the VM can change the thread in which an isolate can run, this means a callback created in one isolate might be invoked on a different or no isolate. However, there are some tweaks around this, as implemented in <u><a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/http/blob/master/pkgs/cupertino_http/src/CUPHTTPClientDelegate.m\">cupertino:http</a></u>.</p><h2 id=\"5g5ah\">FFI Programming: Testing FFIGen</h2><p>Up to this point, we’ve learned how to generate bindings and consume them from a Dart CLI.

Since we are using the YAML file, we specify the result as<a href=\"https://pub.dev/documentation/yaml/latest/yaml/YamlMap-class.html\"> <u>YamlMap</u></a>.
