<h2 id="">TL;DR<h2.new.line><p id=""><em id="">Snippets are small chunks of code that developers save because they might want to use them later. Snippets are useful throughout your workflow as a developer, from researching to developing to collaborating. But many devs don’t use snippets because it’s a hassle to save them. </em><a href="http://pieces.app/" target="_blank" id=""><em id="">Pieces</em></a><em id=""> allows you to save snippets in less than a second from your IDE or Chrome. Best of all, the snippets are auto-formatted and auto-tagged by language and structure for easily finding and re-using later.

Open source code, boilerplate code, analytics tags, SQL queries, loops, algorithms, logging and validation and so much more.<p.new.line><p id="">Think about how much of this sort of code that you likely write and re-write over and over again. Or how much time you waste trying to find that old snippet in that other project somewhere that will save you time.<p.new.line><p id="">So much code that we write as developers is ripe for re-use.
