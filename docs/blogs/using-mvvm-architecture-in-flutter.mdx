<h2 id=""><strong id="">What is Model-View-ViewModel?</strong><h2.new.line><p id=""><strong id="">Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong> Architecture is a unique combination of software architecture patterns that supports the separation of the UI (which is <strong id="">View</strong>) from the development of the business logic or the backend logic (<strong id="">Model</strong>). The view model inside MVVM is the bridge responsible for the conversion of data in a way that behaves in accordance with the changes happening in the UI.<p.new.line><p id="">In addition, to know about the responsibilities of the three components, it’s also important to understand how the components interact with each other. At the highest level, <em id="">the view “knows about” the view model</em>, and <em id="">the view model “knows about” the model</em>, but <em id="">the model is unaware of the view model</em>, and the <em id="">view model is unaware of the view</em>.<p.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ead8e36a005d153f96fea4_0*Plj_xKz_2EwTrXQz.png" alt="A diagram showing the Flutter MVVM architecture." id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"><div.new.line><figcaption id="">Flutter MVVM Architecture</figcaption><figure.new.line><h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of MVVM<h2.new.line><p id="">There are several advantages of MVVM Architecture:<p.new.line><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Separation of Concerns</strong>: This is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern.

If you prefer visual learning, follow along with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q9dxzIo314" target="_blank" id="">video version of this tutorial.</a><p.new.line><h2 id="">MVVM Components<h2.new.line><p id=""><strong id="">Model:</strong> This is basically the domain model, or the model which represents the data from your backend (i.e., the data access layer). Models hold information but typically don’t handle behavior. They don’t format information or influence how data appears. The Model in the MVVM pattern in Flutter represents the actual data that will be used in application development.<p.new.line><p id=""><strong id="">View:</strong> This is basically the only part of the application users actually interact with. For instance, the user presses the button, scrolls the list, edits the settings, etc. These events are then forwarded to the view model, which does the processing and returns the expected user response (which is some form of UI). It’s important to remember the <strong id="">View</strong> isn’t responsible here for handling the state.<p.new.line><p id="">A View should be as dumb as possible. Never put your business logic in a View.<p.new.line><p id=""><strong id="">ViewModel:</strong> The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the <strong id="">View</strong> and the <strong id="">Model</strong>, in such a way that it provides data to the UI. The ViewModel may also expose methods for helping to maintain the View’s state, update the model based on the actions on a View, and trigger events on the View. In <strong id="">Flutter,</strong> we have a listener called <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier-class.html" target="_blank" id="">ChangeNotifier</a> that allows the ViewModel to inform or update the View whenever the data is updated.<p.new.line><p id="">The ViewModel has basically two responsibilities:<p.new.line><ul id=""><li id="">It reacts to user inputs (e.g., by changing the model, initiating network requests, or routing to different screens)<li.new.line><li id="">It offers output data that the View can subscribe to<li.new.line><ul.new.line><p id="">In summary, the ViewModel sits behind the UI layer which is a <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/user-interface-neumorphism-glassmorphism">key user interface principle</a>. It exposes data needed by a View and can be viewed as the source our Views go to for both data and actions.<p.new.line><h3 id="">What is Flutter ChangeNotifier?<h3.new.line><p id=""><a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier-class.html" target="_blank" id="">ChangeNotifier</a> is a class that provides change notifications to its listeners.<p.new.line><p id="">As per the official <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier-class.html" target="_blank" id="">documentation</a>, a ChangeNotifier is:<p.new.line><p id="">A class that can be extended or mixed in that provides a change notification API using VoidCallback for notifications.<p.new.line><p id=""><em id="">It is O(1) for adding listeners and O(N) for removing listeners and dispatching notifications (where N is the number of listeners).</em><p.new.line><p id="">There are two ways to consume the ChangeNotifier in Flutter:<p.new.line><ol id=""><li id="">Using the <em id="">.addListener</em> method, as the ChangeNotifier is a type of <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html" target="_blank" id="">Listenable</a>.<li.new.line><li id="">Using a combination of <em id="">ChangeNotifierProvider,</em> <em id="">Consumer</em>, and <em id="">Provider.</em> These capabilities are provided to us by the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider" target="_blank" id="">Provider</a> package.<li.new.line></ol><p id=""><strong id="">We will use approach 2 in the following flutter ChangeNotifier example.</strong><p.new.line><p id="">In the real world, other classes can <em id="">listen</em> to a <em id="">ChangeNotifier</em> object.

Now, let’s see a slight addition on top of this structure.<p.new.line><h3 id="">Extending the MVVM toolkit with Repository and Services<h3.new.line><p id="">In the real world, our app needs to interact with APIs or third-party integrations. So, we introduce something called a Repository.<p.new.line><p id="">A repository pattern provides an abstraction of data so that your application can work with a simple abstraction that has an interface. Using this pattern can help to achieve loose coupling. If implemented correctly, the Repository pattern can be a great way to ensure you follow the <em id="">Single Responsibility Principle</em> for your data access code.<p.new.line><p id="">Some benefits of using the Repository pattern:<p.new.line><ol id=""><li id="">It separates the business logic for accessing external services<li.new.line><li id="">It makes mocking easier and allows to do unit tests<li.new.line><li id="">It easily switches data sources without doing time-consuming code changes<li.new.line></ol><p id="">Some disadvantages of using the Repository pattern:<p.new.line><ol id=""><li id="">It adds another layer of abstraction, which adds a certain level of complexity, making it overkill for small applications.<li.new.line></ol><p id="">Continuing with the previous example, let’s say our button needs to call an API. Let’s implement it using the <em id="">Repository</em> pattern.<p.new.line><p id="">Dart has no interfaces, like Java, but we can create one with an abstract class. We begin by creating an abstract class that defines the interface for our home_repo.<p.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1040px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1040px"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ebae923c40995a14e4ae33_raycast-untitled%20(69).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A code snippet with Dart code."><div.new.line><figcaption id=""><a href="https://raman.pieces.cloud/?p=9e2b429fe1" target="_blank" id="">Save to Pieces</a></figcaption><figure.new.line><p id="">This abstract class helps to create a boundary, and we are free to work on either side of that boundary. We could work on implementing the home repository (<em id="">recommended</em>), or we could just use the implementation directly in our app (<em id="">not recommended</em>).<p.new.line><p id="">Here, the <em id="">HomeRepository</em> has only one method, <em id="">fetchData</em>.

As per the documentation:<p.new.line><p id="">This is a simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by <em id="">Splat</em>.

After that, you can access instances of the registered types by calling the locator again.<p.new.line><p id="">The nice thing is you can register an interface or abstract class together with a concrete implementation. When accessing the instance, you always ask for the interface/abstract class type. This makes it easy to switch the implementation by just switching the concrete type at registration time.<p.new.line><p id="">We create a file called <em id="">locator.dart</em> inside which we will instantiate the object of <em id="">get_it</em>:<p.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1040px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1040px"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62ebb06cef7fa5045c9734e5_raycast-untitled%20(72).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A code snippet with Dart code that helps to build MVVM Architecture."><div.new.line><figcaption id=""><a href="https://raman.pieces.cloud/?p=b47845a2c2" target="_blank" id="">Save to Pieces</a></figcaption><figure.new.line><p id="">As Dart supports global variables, we assign the GetIt instance to a global variable to make access to it as easy as possible.<p.new.line><p id="">Although GetIt is a singleton, we will assign its instance to a global variable<em id=""> locator </em>to minimize the code for accessing GetIt.
