<p>One of the most well-known frameworks for creating front-end web apps quickly and effectively is Angular. Angular was created by Google and is based on TypeScript, a language created and maintained by Microsoft. Angular has a large number of component libraries that developers should be aware of so they can make the best choices for their projects. Let’s take a look at the 6 best Angular libraries.<p.new.line><h2 id="20lv3">The Top Angular Component Libraries<h2.new.line><h3 id="aegi2"><u>1. <a href="https://material.angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular Material</a></u><h3.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="The Angular Material home page." src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6390c3143c20ed505df9be60_image3_0df01454fe1a6ed30539c05fdcc4a26f_800.png"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p>Angular Material is Angular’s component library that implements Google&#x27;s Material Design.
