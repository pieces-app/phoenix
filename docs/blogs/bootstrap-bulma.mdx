Bulma was created by Jeremy Thomas, and an MIT license is used to license the Bulma source code. In this article, we’ll compare Bulma vs Bootstrap.<p.new.line><h2 id="49fpi">Bulma vs Bootstrap: Features<h2.new.line><h3 id="3vjvf">Bootstrap<h3.new.line><ul><li>Design templates for buttons, navigation, and other elements that are based on HTML and CSS<li.new.line><li>Reusable code with CSS classes<li.new.line><li>Modularity for modifying or eliminating certain components or component colors<li.new.line><li>Components made using JavaScript out of the box that have extra functionality like tooltips, modal windows, etc.<li.new.line><ul.new.line><h3 id="c1btr">Bulma CSS<h3.new.line><ul><li>Every component of Bulma is designed with mobile devices in mind and is optimized for vertical reading<li.new.line><ul><li>Vertically stacked columns<li.new.line><li>The nav menu is hidden<li.new.line><li>The level component displays its children stacked vertically.

Let&#x27;s examine some of Bootstrap&#x27;s cons:<p.new.line><ul><li>You must be familiar with coding to use it. You probably won&#x27;t be able to use Bootstrap if you’re a true beginner. A CMS like WordPress is a better option for non-programmers.<li.new.line><li>You might depend on it excessively. If you become dependent on it, you&#x27;ll never learn how to create a website from scratch (although you may never need to).<li.new.line><li>It might not be as efficient as you would like. Bootstrap has a reputation for being big since it contains everything you could possibly need. It’s not ideal for building modest, straightforward websites.<li.new.line><li>Its naming convention can be perplexing. You must invest the time up front to become familiar with Bootstrap&#x27;s features. Because there is no way to intuit what is present or what it is named, it may necessitate extensive documentation.<li.new.line><ul.new.line><h3 id="9i48c">Bulma CSS<h3.new.line><p>Let’s list some of the advantages of Bulma CSS:<p.new.line><ul><li>Free and open source<li.new.line><li>Lightweight<li.new.line><li>Customizable<li.new.line><li>Platform-independent<li.new.line><li>Simple to use and learn<li.new.line><li>Compatible with the majority of current browsers<li.new.line><li>Mobile-first framework<li.new.line><li>Dependable documentation<li.new.line><li>Supports Font Awesome versions 4 and 5<li.new.line><li>Provides a number of ready-to-use parts<li.new.line><li>Installing JavaScript is not necessary because it offers a lot of helpful tools<li.new.line><ul.new.line><p>Cons of Bulma:<p.new.line><ul><li>Bulma is a CSS-only framework, unlike Bootstrap. It does not come with JavaScript or jQuery preinstalled. Writing a custom script is necessary in order to add some fundamental features to Bulma, such as a toggle, which needs JavaScript or jQuery.<li.new.line><li>Its documentation is generally less strong than Bootstrap’s.<li.new.line><li>It has comparatively little community support to Bootstrap.<li.new.line><ul.new.line><h2 id="3l2v5">Similarities Between Bootstrap and Bulma CSS<h2.new.line><p>Bulma CSS and Bootstrap share some characteristics.
