# A Better Way to Bookmark Code as a Developer

<p id=""><em id="">💡 Trying to bookmark code in your browser is pretty painful when you want to find and revisit that solution later. An easy hack is to save code with </em><a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank"><em id="">Pieces for Developers</em></a><em id="">, which automatically attaches the source URL from where you grabbed the snippet. &nbsp;You can not only find the snippet easily later, but you can hop out to the page it came from to remind yourself about the broader context.</em><p.new.line><p id="">I’m sure most of you search Google to find solutions for errors, from how to sort a list to a breadth-first binary tree traversal to how to establish a database connection.<p.new.line><p id="">Chances are, you bookmark code solutions from some StackOverflow page, thinking it’s saved for the future.<p.new.line><p id="">But revisiting that solution in your bookmarks folder is suboptimal for a bunch of reasons:<p.new.line><ul id=""><li>Unstructured bookmark lists are hard to search, and you have no idea where to start looking for the solution.<li.new.line><li>Maybe you spend a bunch of effort organizing bookmarks, but most of us don’t have time.<li.new.line><li>A bookmark provides minimal information unless you click through each link.<li.new.line><li>Bookmarks save no context for your problem, which is often how you might want to search.<li.new.line><ul.new.line><p id="">Fear not - let’s look at a simple, free bookmarking tool (and WAY more), Pieces for Developers. It’s much more effective at managing your saved links and solutions.<p.new.line><p id="">A much more effective way to bookmark code<p.new.line><p id="">You might know Pieces for Developers as a snippet tool where you can save code and easily find, reuse, or reference it later. One of the more interesting ways I use Pieces is through the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a>, which enables me to save code from any webpage with one click.<p.new.line><p id="">The most killer feature of the Pieces for Chrome extension, though, is Related Links. This makes it far more useful as a home for your URLs. &nbsp;When you save a snippet from a web page using the extension, Pieces automatically saves the URL of the page the snippet came from.<p.new.line><p id="">So when you need that snippet, you can search in Pieces using exact or fuzzy match based on the snippet or the language, and you’ll also find a link to the URL that you originally got the snippet from. THAT is incredibly helpful to refresh on the context around the snippet. Way more helpful than a quickly bookmarked code snippet!<p.new.line><h2 id="crfjs">Let’s look at some examples in the wild...<h2.new.line><h3 id="3snti">Finding Shell Commands<h3.new.line><p id="">If you’ve ever tried bookmarking your dev shell commands, you know it’s much easier to just search for them again than find them in your bookmarks list.<p.new.line><h4 id="">Finding Shell Commands without Pieces:<h4.new.line><ol id=""><li>Open your bookmarks<li.new.line><li>Try to remember what the page was<li.new.line><li>Scroll through an endless list <li.new.line><li>Finally find the link and navigate to it<strong id="">‍‍</strong><li.new.line></ol><h4 id="">Finding Shell Commands with Pieces:<h4.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/620c45471fdc383c72190874_final_61f97c65a9ff2c012a7c5964_686295.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="Searching for a shell command in Pieces."><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p id=""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p.new.line><p id="">1.

Scrolling through a never-ending list of code bookmarks to find their correct usage on W3Schools is a nightmare, isn’t it?
