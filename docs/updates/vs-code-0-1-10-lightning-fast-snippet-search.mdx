## Multi-cursor bug fix
We’ve crushed a bug in multi-cursor mode, where only the first selected line would copy even if multiple lines had been selected.
We temporarily disabled Snippet Auto-Save when we pushed out a hot fix; Auto-Save is now re-enabled and copy + paste in multi-cursor mode is back to normal.
