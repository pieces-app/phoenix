# VS Code 0.1.10: Lightning-fast snippet search
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:18:05 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

On our mission to supercharge your workflow, we know that searching your snippets is hyper-critical, especially as you start to add more snippets to Pieces. In today’s release for VS Code, we’re excited to introduce a blazing fast way to search your pieces - Search-and-insert!

## Search and insert snippets
Search-and-insert allows you to search for a snippet from your Pieces library and add it to your file, all without touching your mouse.
To begin searching, hit <code>CTRL + K</code> or <code>CMD + K</code>, search for a snippet and hit <code>Enter</code>. (You can also right-click and select “Search Pieces”.)

## Multi-cursor bug fix
We’ve crushed a bug in multi-cursor mode, where only the first selected line would copy even if multiple lines had been selected.
We temporarily disabled Snippet Auto-Save when we pushed out a hot fix; Auto-Save is now re-enabled and copy + paste in multi-cursor mode is back to normal.
