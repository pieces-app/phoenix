# Pieces for Developers™ Desktop App 1.10.0: Introducing Workflow Activity, Suggested Snippets & a 10x Speed Boost. Happy Holidays 🎁
> Mon Mar 27 2023 17:16:30 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>It’s hard to believe that just a year ago, we released the ability to extract code from screenshots in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App. Over the past 14 releases, we’ve dropped workflow-revolutionizing features, including Snippet Discovery, Shareable Links, Collections, and more. Today, we’re proud to announce several significant steps towards realizing our vision for Pieces: Workflow Activity View, Suggested Snippets, Dramatically improved performance and support for Linux Operating Systems. 🥳 <p.new.line><h2 id="b7eaf">Pieces for Developers Desktop App<h2.new.line><h3 id="35rf8">Workflow Activity view now in beta<h3.new.line><p>Pick up where you left off faster than ever ⚡️ Workflow Activity view is now in beta!
