# Pieces for Developers‚Ñ¢ Desktop App 1.10.0: Introducing Workflow Activity, Suggested Snippets & a 10x Speed Boost. Happy Holidays üéÅ
> Mon Mar 27 2023 17:16:30 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

It‚Äôs hard to believe that just a year ago, we released the ability to extract code from screenshots in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App. Over the past 14 releases, we‚Äôve dropped workflow-revolutionizing features, including Snippet Discovery, Shareable Links, Collections, and more. Today, we‚Äôre proud to announce several significant steps towards realizing our vision for Pieces: Workflow Activity View, Suggested Snippets, Dramatically improved performance and support for Linux Operating Systems. ü•≥ 

## Pieces for Developers Desktop App
### Workflow Activity view now in beta
Pick up where you left off faster than ever ‚ö°Ô∏è Workflow Activity view is now in beta! From the desktop app, you can view a chronological timeline of when you create, delete, share, and manage context for your snippets. Stay tuned for more to start populating into the feed from around your workflow.

Check out snippets you‚Äôve created, shared, reclassified, edited and more by clicking the ‚ÄòWorkflow Activity‚Äô button to the left of the search bar or by tapping CMD/CTRL+Shift+A.

### Create a snippet from scratch
This has been on our list for a long time. You‚Äôve always been able to create a snippet in the desktop app by pasting copied code into the window, but now you can type directly into the desktop app to create a snippet!
Simply click the ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô button (or CMD/CTRL+N) above the carousel and start typing! You can also paste copied code or text into this window, if you‚Äôd like.

### Suggested Snippets View
You're now able to sort your Carousel View by Suggestions & Relevance based on recently saved Pieces. We want users to be able to reference, share, and reuse the right snippets at the right time. We're only getting started. Look for the &quot;Sort&quot; buttons to give it a try!

### Lightning-fast performance
With each update we strive to make Pieces faster and faster ‚ö° You'll notice significant performance improvements when creating, updating, and deleting your Pieces.

### Bug fixes & general improvements
This release also includes general improvements and bug fixes. If you ever notice a bug or have a feature you‚Äôd like to request, <a href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let us know</a>! We want Pieces to work seamlessly for you.

## Pieces OS 3.1.0 üöÄ
Pieces OS powers the entire Pieces for Developers Suite‚Äî and it gets better every day. This release includes exciting new features and a number of helpful upgrades to existing ones.

### Export an asset as Markdown
App developers can now generate Markdown previews of assets by calling a simple endpoint. You‚Äôll see this endpoint in action in the Pieces for Developers VS Code and JetBrains plugins.

### Export an asset as HTML
Among the updates to exporting an asset as HTML is the ability to apply inline CSS to exported HTML assets. This is important for our next sharing upgrade‚Äî sharing snippets in an email (coming soon!).

### Populate an asset with metadata before it‚Äôs created
Interested in knowing the metadata attached to a snippet before you save it to Pieces? The latest version of Pieces OS introduces a new endpoint that will enable app developers to populate an asset with metadata before it‚Äôs officially created. 

### Mega Performance Improvements
Faster boot up, faster asset snapshots, updates to the code similarity algorithm and updates to Snippet Discovery‚Äî we‚Äôre working to make Pieces faster and more reliable with each and every update.

## Pieces Suite now available for Linux
The Pieces Suite is now compatible with Linux! We released it to Alpha testers a while ago, and now the Beta version is <a href="https://code.pieces.app/desktop/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available for download</a>.
Our team has been working toward a Linux release for a long time. We‚Äôre thrilled to bring all of Pieces‚Äô functionality to Linux users üéâ
