# Pieces for Developers™ Desktop App 1.10.0: Introducing Workflow Activity, Suggested Snippets & a 10x Speed Boost. Happy Holidays 🎁
> Mon Mar 27 2023 17:16:30 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>It’s hard to believe that just a year ago, we released the ability to extract code from screenshots in the Pieces for
    Developers Desktop App. Over the past 14 releases, we’ve dropped workflow-revolutionizing features, including
    Snippet Discovery, Shareable Links, Collections, and more. Today, we’re proud to announce several significant steps
    towards realizing our vision for Pieces: Workflow Activity View, Suggested Snippets, Dramatically improved
    performance and support for Linux Operating Systems. 🥳 </p><h2 id="b7eaf">Pieces for Developers Desktop App</h2><h3

    Activity view is now in beta! From the desktop app, you can view a chronological timeline of when you create,
    delete, share, and manage context for your snippets. Stay tuned for more to start populating into the feed from
    around your workflow.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image"

    button to the left of the search bar or by tapping CMD/CTRL+Shift+A.</p><h3 id="bnsoa">Create a snippet from
    scratch</h3><p>This has been on our list for a long time. You’ve always been able to create a snippet in the desktop
    app by pasting copied code into the window, but now you can type directly into the desktop app to create a
    snippet!</p><p>Simply click the ‘Add’ button (or CMD/CTRL+N) above the carousel and start typing! You can also paste
    copied code or text into this window, if you’d like.</p><figure

    it a try!</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image"
