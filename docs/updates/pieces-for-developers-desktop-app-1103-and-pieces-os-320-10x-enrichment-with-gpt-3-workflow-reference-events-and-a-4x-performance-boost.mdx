# Pieces for Developers Desktop App 1.10.3 and Pieces OS 3.2.0: 10X Enrichment with GPT-3 🤯, Workflow Reference Events, and a 4X Performance Boost ⚡️
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

We're super excited to announce the release of Pieces for Developers Desktop App 1.10.3 and Pieces OS 3.2.0. This release brings an exciting integration with OpenAI’s GPT-3 to boost all of the auto-generated context metadata for your materials. Further, Workflow Activity is now more helpful when backtracking through your workflow, thanks to the introduction of Reference activities, a clearer UI, and improved loading performance. This release also includes a major boost to performance throughout the app, most notably 75% faster boot-up & search times!

## 10x Enrichment: Pieces for Developers + GPT = 🤯
We’ve been enriching your materials in Pieces for Developers with smart descriptions, related links, and tags for months, but they’re about to get a whole lot better. In this release, we’ve integrated with <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI’s</a> <a href="https://openai.com/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a> model to supercharge all of the auto-generated context metadata for your materials.
The GPT-3 Integration instantly brings improved related links, tags, and smart descriptions to all of your materials. Plus, now each material will feature suggested searches, which can be used to easily find and access that material later on. The upgraded related links enrichment now automatically associates videos, tutorials, documents, open-source packages, SDKs, and more. Check it out in the information view within the <a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pieces for Developers Desktop App</a>!

All of your newly created snippets will receive these enhanced descriptions and titles— your existing snippets will, too! Check your snippets after updating for metadata that’s even more useful.
Note: GPT-3 data may take a few seconds to process; updates will load in automatically when complete.

## Workflow Activity: New Material Reference Events
You will now see new &quot;Reference&quot; activity events when browsing Workflow Activity. As you browse and search Pieces for Developers, we'll log an activity event for the materials you reference as well as any search queries you used to get there. Enter a search query to give it a try!

Those recently referenced materials and queries will always be at the top of the Workflow Activity view for you to easily access or backtrack later on.
