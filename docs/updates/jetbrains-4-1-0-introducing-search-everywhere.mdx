# JetBrains 4.1.0: Introducing Search Everywhere
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:26:26 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>Introducing Search Everywhere in Pieces for JetBrains!</p><p>We know that staying deep in your flow is the best way
    to make the most of your time, and as you add more snippets to Pieces, search becomes increasingly critical and
    searching within your tools is a must have. Today we’re excited to release Search Everywhere for the JetBrains
    suite. This feature gives you three ways to find and insert snippets from Pieces - via right-click, Auto-Complete or
    Search Everywhere.</p><p>To search everywhere, hit [⇧⇧] or [⌘⇧P]. In the search dialogue, type what you’re looking
    for and you’ll get results from your entire IDE based on the name, description and contents of your snippets and
    files. If you navigate to the Pieces tab in the dialogue, you’ll only see results from your personal Pieces
    repo.</p><p>Use the arrow keys to select a snippet, hit Enter, and keep on coding.</p><figure
