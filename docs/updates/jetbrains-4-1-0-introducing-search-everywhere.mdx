# JetBrains 4.1.0: Introducing Search Everywhere
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:26:26 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Introducing Search Everywhere in Pieces for JetBrains!

We know that staying deep in your flow is the best way to make the most of your time, and as you add more snippets to Pieces, search becomes increasingly critical and searching within your tools is a must have. Today we’re excited to release Search Everywhere for the JetBrains suite. This feature gives you three ways to find and insert snippets from Pieces - via right-click, Auto-Complete or Search Everywhere.

To search everywhere, hit [⇧⇧] or [⌘⇧P]. In the search dialogue, type what you’re looking for and you’ll get results from your entire IDE based on the name, description and contents of your snippets and files. If you navigate to the Pieces tab in the dialogue, you’ll only see results from your personal Pieces repo.

Use the arrow keys to select a snippet, hit Enter, and keep on coding.
