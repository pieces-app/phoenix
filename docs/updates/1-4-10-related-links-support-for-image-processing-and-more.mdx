# Were excited to announce the release of 1.4.10.

The headliners in this release include:
- Related Links: when saving a code snippet, context is critical. It's often useful to associate related web pages with your code snippets. Now you can, simply by tapping CMD+K to associate any number of URLs to a piece.
- Image Processing: Pieces OS now contains all the infrastructure needed to store and process images, including screenshots. User-facing upgrades will be out in a couple of weeks.
