# Pieces for JetBrains 5.0.0: Explore Materials with Pieces Insights üîé
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:28:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The insanely useful Explore Materials with Pieces Insights feature just landed in Pieces for JetBrains! Understand new codebases more quickly, easily document your code, or collaborate with large teams by writing clear, helpful comments in seconds. We‚Äôre thrilled to introduce this brand-new functionality and we can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs next.

## Explore with Pieces Insights
Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without necessarily saving it to your repository.

To Explore a material:
- Right-click and select ‚ÄúExplore with Pieces Insights‚Äù
- Click on the ‚ÄúView Insights‚Äù message in the lower right corner of your IDE
- Pieces will open a new window with a markdown file that showcases your snippet, its description, and other associated metadata.

### Pieces Insights Settings
With a feature this huge, we like to make sure that you can customize it as much as possible. Explore Materials with Pieces Insights includes several settings, accessible in the plugin settings menu.
If this setting is enabled, the automatically generated description will be placed as a comment above the material that you just explored. This is enabled by default.
This option is automatically off; turning it on will save your Explored Snippets and their insights‚Äî plus all of the other automatically generated context‚Äî to your Pieces repository.
The materials that you explore are not necessarily auto-saved to Pieces, but they are saved in the Pieces Insights panel. If you choose to manually save one of those explored materials to Pieces, enabling this setting will automatically remove that snippet from the Pieces Insights Panel. If this is not enabled, the explored material will exist in both the Pieces Insights Panel and your Pieces repository.

### Domain-Specific Insights Settings
There‚Äôs one more customization option available: Domain-specific insights. You can choose to make your Pieces Insights available across JetBrains IDEs or keep them confined to the IDE you‚Äôre using when you explore a material. Head to the Pieces for JetBrains Settings to make your decision!
