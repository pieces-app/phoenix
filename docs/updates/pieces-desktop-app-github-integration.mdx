By combining Pieces and GitHub, you can take all of GitHub’s amazing features (collaboration, repositories, project management, issue tracking… the list goes on) and add the auto-magic context, easy access across your development environment, and local-first security offered by the Pieces for Developers Suite. Over time, we’ll become even more deeply connected to GitHub and your other favorite dev tools.<p.new.line><h3 id="brgr0">10X Collaboration with Sharing via GitHub Gists<h3.new.line><p>Increase collaboration with your team, mentees, or developers around the world by sharing your saved materials via GitHub Gists!

### Existing GitHub Gists, Meet Pieces for Developers
Already have GitHub Gists? Amazing! 🥳 We’re giving GitHub Gist users a super simple way to automatically import their Gists to Pieces for Developers. This is helpful for a variety of reasons:
- Find your Gists extremely easily without ever opening your browser, and even directly within your IDE using the Pieces for Developers VS Code or JetBrains Plugins.
- Choose the option “Select Gists”
- Make sure Pieces is connected to your GitHub account
- Browse your Gists in the Desktop App and select the ones you’d like to import
- Done! 🎉
Overall, this feature represents a major step forward in our mission to provide users with the most seamless and intuitive coding experience possible. Whether you&#x27;re a seasoned developer or just starting out, the ability to import your existing GitHub Gists is sure to make your life as a developer easier.
## General Snippet Discovery Improvements
Snippet Discovery is an extremely unique, helpful feature our team is proud to have introduced for our users. In Pieces for Developers 1.11.0, Snippet Discovery got some exciting UI upgrades and performance improvements to make the process easier, more precise, and much faster.
Most notably, you will notice larger code previews that have more space for top-level context about the snippet. Today, when importing GitHub Gists, you’ll notice Related People associated with those Gists, but in the near future, we’re excited to surface Smart Descriptions, Related Links, and more. Stay tuned! 😇
## Smarter, Faster Search with 3 New Search Modes
As our users save more and more materials, we want them to find 🔍 these materials as quickly as possible, and in a manner that works best for them. This release comes with three exciting search modes you can toggle right from the search bar, and customize to your liking via the Settings Menu.
- Full Text Search (FTS): Search against the code or text values of the saved material
- Neural Code Search (NCS): Search via natural language to find certain materials based on a set of ML-based heuristics
To change your default search mode, navigate to the “Customize” section in the Desktop App Settings Menu. This ensures that your search mode is configured to your liking between app restarts.

## Link Pieces Accounts with the New Accounts &amp; Cloud Integrations Menu
Now, with the introduction of our GitHub Integration, users can connect Pieces with your Google or GitHub accounts, and even link two accounts together. 🖇️
Since we plan to add more features like this in the future, we’ve added a brand-new section to the Settings Menu called “Accounts &amp; Cloud Integrations.” From this section, you can navigate to a dedicated menu to manage your connected accounts, connect new ones if you’re disconnected, or sign out altogether.
Check it out by tapping the comma (,) key on your keyboard while the Pieces desktop app has focus.

Along with these brand-new workflow-enhancing features, the latest version of the Pieces Desktop App includes a whole bunch of bug fixes, performance improvements, and user enhancements.
