# Pieces for VS Code 0.2.0: Brand-New Search Experience 🔎, Upgraded Extension ReadMe 📖
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:11:26 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The first Pieces for VS Code release of 2023! 🎉 This year, we’re placing a large emphasis on user experience and making the VS Code Extension an irreplaceable part of your development workflow. Today’s release brings more power and customization to searching, along with a series of UX improvements, and a brand new Extension ReadMe that provides an abundance of helpful information about using the Extension.

## New Global Search Settings and Display Preferences
The Pieces for Developers VS Code Extension already had a powerful search experience, but now you can fine-tune that search to find exactly what you need. With this release, you have the power to choose your search parameters, search display, and the actions that result from searching for a snippet.

### Search By
Pick your parameters! You can now search by the contents of a snippet, its name, and/or its tags. Specify any of the following combinations in your Pieces for VS Code settings:
- Name, Tags, & Snippets (Default)
- Name & Tags
- Name & Snippets

### Search Display
When you’re searching for a snippet, it can be useful to see the snippet you’re searching for, plus some extra context in the search results. In the new search display, you can choose to show the Name, Tags, and Contents, or the Name, Tags, and Description (metadata only!) of any snippet that matches your search.

### Search Result Action
Finally, you can customize what happens after you select the snippet you just searched for. Choose from the following actions in your Pieces for VS Code settings:
- Open in Overview (Default)
- Insert snippet at cursor position
- Open in Overview & Copy to Clipboard
- Copy to clipboard only
