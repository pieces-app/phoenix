Every November, we gather the entire Pieces team from across the globe and take a week to work on passion projects that have been put aside during the rest of our hectic year. We had loads of fun spending time together and blew past our goals — you’ll be seeing what we worked on in the weeks and months to come!
In between laying groundwork and building steam for future features, we published 22 articles, pushed 2 releases and hit several milestones that we’ve been working toward for months. Read all about what we’ve been up to in November.

<strong>10x’ed Snippet Discovery</strong>™<strong> in the Pieces Desktop App</strong>
We love Snippet Discovery— inputting a file and receiving useful snippets helps developers save time, increase efficiency and write more standardized code. With this release, Snippet Discovery received a 10x upgrade that increases the fidelity of the snippets we discover for you.

<strong>Introducing Snippet Discovery in the Web Extensions</strong>
This month, we launched Snippet Discovery for the web in our Web Extensions. From the popover menu, you can view and save snippets from up to the last five webpages you’ve visited. With one click, the snippet and its context are saved to Pieces— and you don’t have to backtrack or scroll up and down a page.
