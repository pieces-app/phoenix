# JetBrains 5.1.0: Discover Related Materials in Pieces 🧩
> Mon Apr 03 2023 18:36:07 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>Your time is seriously valuable! So, we&#x27;ve added the Find Related Materials function to the Pieces for JetBrains
    Plugin. This feature is designed to help developers streamline their search process for code snippets and other
    materials. By selecting a piece of code in your editor and using &quot;Find Related Materials,&quot; you can easily
    search through your saved snippets, making it even easier to reference, reuse, and share on the fly.</p><h2
    id="dlji2">Related Materials</h2><p>If you have more than one snippet, you can ask Pieces for Developers to
    recommend Related Materials with a simple right click. Just right-click on the snippet preview and select “Find
    Related Materials in Pieces.” Your Related Materials will appear in a new tab in the Pieces List view called,
    “Related Materials to Current Selection.”</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"

    with One Click</h2><p>Do you ever preview a bunch of snippets at one time? This new feature is for you. When you
    right click in your editor and select “Close all snippets,” all of the snippet preview tabs will close except for
    the one you have in focus. Save time closing irrelevant tabs!</p><figure
