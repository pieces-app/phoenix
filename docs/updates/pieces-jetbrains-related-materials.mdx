# JetBrains 5.1.0: Discover Related Materials in Pieces üß©
> Mon Apr 03 2023 18:36:07 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Your time is seriously valuable! So, we've added the Find Related Materials function to the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin. This feature is designed to help developers streamline their search process for code snippets and other materials. By selecting a piece of code in your editor and using &quot;Find Related Materials,&quot; you can easily search through your saved snippets, making it even easier to reference, reuse, and share on the fly.

## Related Materials
If you have more than one snippet, you can ask Pieces for Developers to recommend Related Materials with a simple right click. Just right-click on the snippet preview and select ‚ÄúFind Related Materials in Pieces.‚Äù Your Related Materials will appear in a new tab in the Pieces List view called, ‚ÄúRelated Materials to Current Selection.‚Äù

From there, just insert the snippet you need and you‚Äôre good to go!

## Close all Snippets with One Click
Do you ever preview a bunch of snippets at one time? This new feature is for you. When you right click in your editor and select ‚ÄúClose all snippets,‚Äù all of the snippet preview tabs will close except for the one you have in focus. Save time closing irrelevant tabs!
