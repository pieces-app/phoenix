# 1.5.6: Key bug fixes and UX improvements
> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:22:13 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

At Pieces, we strive to place as much emphasis on the little things as we do on the big things. That&#x27;s why we pay extra attention to detail to make sure you have the smoothest user experience possible. This release doesn&#x27;t include any fancy new features, but rather many small bug fixes and UX improvements users have noticed along their journey. (But, the fancy new features are on their way!)
## Pieces for Developers
<em>Pieces for Developers is the core user-facing Pieces application. Get started for free <a href="http://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em>

This release comes with too many small bug fixes and improvements to list, but here are some of the more persistent ones you may have experienced:

### Managing Pieces
- [Bug fix] All menus related to managing a snippet (Related Links, Quick Menu, Tags) are now inaccessible if you don&#x27;t have any snippets
- [Bug fix] You can no longer add an empty tag

### Finding Pieces
- [Bug fix] If you previously entered a search query that contained either a parenthesis or bracket character and got a big grey screen in return — this is now fixed

### Installing &amp; Configuring Pieces
- [Bug fix] Windows toolbar buttons (close, minimize, expand) didn&#x27;t show on all views — they are now back
- [Bug fix] If you tried to change the theme of PFD with the Settings Menu open, you may have noticed everything changes except for the menu itself — this is now fixed

## Pieces API
<em>Everything we develop is on top of the Pieces API. We&#x27;re excited to welcome third-party developers who want to build applications on top of our infrastructure. Email us at support@pieces.app for more details.</em>
