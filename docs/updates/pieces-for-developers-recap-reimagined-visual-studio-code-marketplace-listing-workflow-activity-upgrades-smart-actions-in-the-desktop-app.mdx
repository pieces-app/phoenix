## Feature Highlights ⎸ Quality of Life Improvements ✅ in our Flagship Desktop App + An Overhauled Search in our Visual Studio Code Extension 🤯
### <strong>Preview Before Paste</strong>
Copy and paste can lead to errors, especially when you’re working fast. Sometimes you captured an extra line or two, or you still have an old snippet, block of text, image or link copied. With <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-desktop-app-1102-and-pieces-os-311-workflow-activity-now-with-top-level-metadata-preview-before-paste-snippet-indent-clean-up">Clipboard Preview</a>, you can now see what is on your clipboard before you paste it into your Pieces Desktop App.
Simply hover over the “Paste” suggested action, and you will see the contents of your clipboard before you commit to creating a snippet.

### <strong>Smart Indentation ➡️ A new Suggested Quick Action: (Currently in Beta)</strong>
Sometimes when you’re copying a code snippet from a larger source file, the code snippet carries over extra indentation… this can be really annoying when trying to reference or reuse the snippet later on. We dropped in a new suggested quick action which helps you to tidy up this inconsistent indentation in a single click. In case our indent cleanup didn’t get it right, we made it super easy to revert the change.

### <strong>Upgraded Search Experience in Pieces for VS Code</strong>
The Pieces for Developers VS Code Extension already had a powerful search experience, but now you can fine-tune that search to find exactly what you need. With this release, you have the power to choose your search parameters, search display, and the actions that result from searching for a snippet.

### Pieces for JetBrains Support for Image-Based Snippets
One of the most useful features of the Pieces for Developers Suite is extracting code from screenshots, thereby transforming images of code into editable, useful code. Those image-based snippets weren’t super useful in Pieces for JetBrains— until this month.
Now you can view your code screenshots & images right within your JetBrains IDE, and easily copy the code extracted from those images, too.
