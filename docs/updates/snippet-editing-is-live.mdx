# Snippet editing is live!
> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:30:34 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Throughout the last few weeks, we’ve received a ton of feedback and ideas from users, and we couldn’t be more appreciative. We’re listening intently and working hard to make Pieces indispensable to your workflow.
One of the most common requests (especially from our internal users!) is to be able to lightly edit a snippet saved in Pieces. <strong>Well, we’re happy to let you know that now you can!</strong>
