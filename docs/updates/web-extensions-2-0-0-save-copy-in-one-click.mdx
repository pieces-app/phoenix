# Web Extensions 2.0.0: Save & copy in one click
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

Beaming useful snippets from the web to your IDE is one of the most game-changing workflow hacks we can imagine. We’re thrilled to be improving that experience even further with version 2.0.0 of the Pieces web extensions for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave and other Chromium-based browsers. Coming soon: Firefox!

## Copy and Save button
The “Copy and Save” button is now doing double duty – when you save a snippet, that snippet is also automatically copied to your clipboard.

## Get Link button
Introducing shareable links in the Pieces web extensions! When you click “Get Link,” Pieces generates a link containing that snippet and its context (related links, the source and more). Now it’s easier to share the exact snippet you want from a webpage without removing other helpful details.

**Note: In order to generate shareable links, you must have Pieces OS and the Pieces desktop app, and you must be connected to the cloud.**

## Bug fixes and performance improvements
Finally, this release includes improved logic for detecting code blocks on websites, including previously unsupported sites like <a href="http://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">angular.io</a> and <a href="http://w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w3schools.com</a>, as well as a variety of bug fixes.

## Support
