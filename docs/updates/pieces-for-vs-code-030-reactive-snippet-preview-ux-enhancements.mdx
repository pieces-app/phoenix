# Pieces for VS Code 0.3.0: Reactive Snippet Preview & UX Enhancements
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:14:56 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>One way to make big changes is to aggregate a bunch of small improvements. While we’re definitely working on huge new features, today we’re making a big impact on the way you use Pieces for VS Code by shipping a Reactive Snippet Preview, a bunch of bug fixes, and user experience improvements that will help you further customize your metadata and streamline how you work.</p><h2 id="1m08h">Upgraded Markdown Preview</h2><p>When you preview a snippet, it pops up as a Markdown preview in a new window. That preview is now reactive! When you right-click your snippet in tree view, you can add links or tags. Then, once you hit enter, the preview automatically updates.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="The reactive markdown preview in Pieces for VS Code." src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63d98dc17b0cd74bad03872e_vscode0_3_0_78ba35613576ab072c1242e1a1f1ce4a.gif" /></div></figure><p>You can add more than one tag or link at a time by adding a comma between values. Plus, shareable links are now viewable in a snippet’s Markdown preview.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="Shareable links in the VS Code Markdown preview." src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/63d98dc17b0cd767d103872d_Screenshot2023-01-31at3_44_46PM_b865bc29ac6571676dd8aaed473a08e4_800.jpeg" /></div></figure><h2 id="cu15k">Bug Fixes and User Experience Improvements</h2><ul><li>Previously, you may have gotten a series of “Failed to Connect to Pieces OS” messages when you added metadata to a snippet— Now, you’ll get one notification instead.</li><li>If you try to generate a shareable link but you’re not signed in or connected to the cloud, now you’ll see a “Sign in” button with the error message.</li><li>We’ve added a 3-second timeout on success messages when you add metadata.</li><li>The onboarding flow now pops up in a window in VS Code instead of redirecting to the web to reduce the disruption to your day.</li><li>The plugin icon is now a puzzle piece.</li></ul><h2 id="435f7">Join our Beta Testing Program</h2><p>Do you want to try the newest features of Pieces before they’re released?
