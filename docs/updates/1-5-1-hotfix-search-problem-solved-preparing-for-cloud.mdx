# 1.5.1 [Hotfix]: Search problem solved & preparing for Cloud
> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:07:29 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

In late December we launched version 1.5.0 of Pieces, which introduced powerful OCR capabilities among many other exciting new features and enhancements. Check out the release notes <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/1-5-0-extract-code-from-screenshots-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

This is a patch release that solves an issue Users experienced in 1.5.0 with the search experience in Pieces for Developers where the app would not show the correct snippet when clearing the search query.
Later this month we will be releasing a larger update with preliminary cloud support, snippet editing, and an upgraded information view, so stay tuned for more in the coming weeks.
