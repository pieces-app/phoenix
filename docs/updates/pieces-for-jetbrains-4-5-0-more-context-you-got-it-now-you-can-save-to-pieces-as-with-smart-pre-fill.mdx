# Pieces for JetBrains 4.5.0: More Context? You got it ✅ Now you can “Save to Pieces As…” with Smart Pre-Fill 🤯
> Mon Mar 27 2023 17:39:34 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The most valuable features of Pieces are quickly saving snippets and effortlessly enriching them. Today, we’re introducing an additional method to save and enrich your snippets in JetBrains: Save to Pieces As.

Just like the “Save As” you know and love, when you select this option, a dialogue window will pop up with pre-generated context, e.g., a title, tags, a description, related links, related people and more. From that window, you can edit all of the contextual metadata of your snippet.
You’ve always been able to edit this metadata, but now you can do so without additional clicks or navigating to a different application.

To use “Save to Pieces As...”:
- Highlight a chunk of code in your IDE
- Right-click
- Select “Save to Pieces As...” from the context menu

- This pre-filled window will pop up:

- In this dialogue, you can modify the automatically generated metadata and add your own.

- Once you’re done, hit “OK” and your snippet - and its context - will be instantly saved to Pieces.
