# Pieces for VS Code 0.4.0: Brand-New Suggested Materials View ✨
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:23:41 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The demands on developers increase every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.
With that, our team has invested serious resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
We're excited for you to check out Suggested Materials View, which is based on your recently saved materials, available now in Pieces for Visual Studio Code!

## Suggested Materials View
No more searching through countless files for the code you’re looking for— our new feature will surface the right snippet for you when you need it.
Much like Suggested Snippets View in the Pieces Desktop App, the Pieces for Visual Studio Code Extension now offers the option to view your snippets grouped by language or in our Suggested Materials View. The Suggested Materials View aims to show you the exact snippet you need precisely when you need it— and our suggestions will only get better the more you use it!
