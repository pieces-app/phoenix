# Pieces for UltraEdit available for beta release
> Mon Mar 27 2023 13:43:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Today&#x27;s a big day at Pieces as we&#x27;re excited to beta release the <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app/ue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pieces for UltraEdit integration</a>! This is a landmark for us as this is the first integration on top of the Pieces app built entirely by a third-party developer - in this case, our friends and partners at <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/ultraedit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UltraEdit</a>.

## Here&#x27;s how to get started:
- Download UltraEdit 28
- <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download Pieces</a> if it&#x27;s not already running on your machine

That&#x27;s it! UltraEdit will automatically detect Pieces and activate key features in UltraEdit.

## So what does the Pieces for UltraEdit integration do?
When the integration is active, you&#x27;ll find a right-click context menu for Pieces inside UltraEdit that packs a lot of punch:
- Right-click (or hit CTRL-P twice) to save highlighted code or entire files to Pieces without leaving UltraEdit
- Right-click to insert snippets you&#x27;ve previously saved to Pieces. You&#x27;ll find all your snippets auto-organized by language.
The best part? You don&#x27;t have to even have Pieces open to perform these actions. Stay in your flow, and save/retrieve just what you want without leaving UltraEdit.
And rest assured - all your snippets are saved in the dedicated Pieces app if you want to the full experience of searching, renaming, recategorizing and more.

## What&#x27;s up next on the Pieces for UltraEdit product roadmap?
- Back up individual or all your pieces to the cloud
- Sharing a piece with colleagues

## Send us feedback!
Pieces for UltraEdit is free through the end of the year. Tell your friends and colleagues and share feedback anytime at support@pieces.app or hit [SHIFT + !] from inside the Pieces app.
