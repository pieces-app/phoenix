> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:26:35 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Today, we‚Äôre launching a brand-new feature for the Pieces for Developers VS Code Extension: Explore with Pieces Insights. This feature will help developers of all skill levels understand new codebases more quickly, easily document their code, and help large teams to collaborate by writing clear, helpful comments. Check it out ‚¨áÔ∏è

## Explore with Pieces Insights
There‚Äôs a new functionality of the Pieces for Developers VS Code Extension in town! Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without saving it to your repository.

To Explore a material:
- Right-click and select ‚ÄúExplore with Pieces Insights‚Äù or hit ```Shift+Alt+E``` (Windows)/```Shift+Option+E``` (MacOS)
- Click the ‚ÄúView Insights‚Äù success message in the lower right corner of your editor
- Pieces will open a new window with a markdown file that showcases your snippet, its description, and other associated metadata.

To revisit explored materials, check out the new section titled ‚ÄúExplored Materials & Snippet Insights‚Äù in the Extension Tree View. Here, you can view your explored materials, save them to Pieces, or delete them‚Äî just right-click.
If you‚Äôd like to automatically save your explored materials to your Pieces repository, toggle on ‚ÄúExplore and Save‚Äù in your extension settings.

<strong>Note:</strong> In order to Explore Materials, you must be connected to your Pieces Cloud.

## Document with Pieces Insights
Are you loving the Pieces-generated explanations of your Explored Materials? You can automatically insert those descriptions as comments above the explored material!

By default, the Pieces for VS Code Extension will automatically add comments of the description above your Explored Materials. To turn this off, uncheck ‚ÄúDocument with Pieces Insights‚Äù in the Extension settings.
