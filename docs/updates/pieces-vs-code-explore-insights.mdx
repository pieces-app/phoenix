## Explore with Pieces Insights
There’s a new functionality of the Pieces for Developers VS Code Extension in town! Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without saving it to your repository.
To Explore a material:
- Right-click and select “Explore with Pieces Insights” or hit [Shift+Alt+E] (Windows)/[Shift+Option+E] (MacOS)
- Click the “View Insights” success message in the lower right corner of your editor
- Pieces will open a new window with a markdown file that showcases your snippet, its description, and other associated metadata.
To revisit explored materials, check out the new section titled “Explored Materials &amp; Snippet Insights” in the Extension Tree View. Here, you can view your explored materials, save them to Pieces, or delete them— just right-click.
If you’d like to automatically save your explored materials to your Pieces repository, toggle on “Explore and Save” in your extension settings.
<strong>Note:</strong> In order to Explore Materials, you must be connected to your Pieces Cloud.
## Document with Pieces Insights
Are you loving the Pieces-generated explanations of your Explored Materials? You can automatically insert those descriptions as comments above the explored material!
