# Pieces for VS Code 0.6.0: Select Some Code. Find Related Materials. ✨
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:27:46 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>As a developer, your time is seriously valuable, which is why we&#x27;ve added the Find Related Materials function to
    our Visual Studio Code extension. This feature is designed to help developers streamline their search process for
    code snippets and other materials. By selecting a piece of code in your editor and using &quot;Find Related
    Materials in Pieces,&quot; you can easily search through your saved snippets, making it even easier to reference,
    reuse, and share on the fly. With Pieces for Developers, you can now spend more time developing and less time
    searching through code libraries.</p><h2 id="ehl3e">Find Related Materials in Pieces</h2><p>Sometimes you know
    you’ve saved a helpful snippet to your current project, but you can’t remember exactly what it is. By using Pieces
    to find Related Materials, you can easily discover the snippet you were looking for, or a different, equally useful
    snippet.</p><p>Highlight some code in your editor, right-click, and select “Find Related Materials in Pieces.”
    Pieces will search your saved snippets and display any related materials in the Side Panel, so that you can easily
    add them to your project.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"

    Selection” in the Extension Settings.</p><h2 id="fa03n">Customize Side Panel View</h2><p>With the introduction of
    Related Materials, Pieces for VS Code offers six Side Panel Views with useful information. While you can toggle them
    open or closed at any point, if you’d like to make the Side Panel a little less noisy, head to your Extension
    Settings. From there, you can toggle off any Side Panel Views that you don’t want right now!</p><figure
