# Pieces for VS Code 0.1.19: Life's good with fewer bugs 🐛 and better performance ⚡️
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

We’re working hard to support the more than 11,000 developers who have downloaded Pieces for VS Code! Today’s release includes several bug fixes and quality of life improvements to our extension, plus some groundwork for our next big feature: sharing snippets via email. 👀

## Version Check
We’ve added a version check to make sure that your version of Pieces for VS Code is compatible with your version Pieces OS. If they’re incompatible, you’ll see an error. You can fix this error by updating Pieces to the latest version!

## Quality of Life Improvements
To make your life a little easier, we’ve improved a few little things.
The “Refresh” and “Settings” icons are now only displayed in your snippet tree view— there was previously a bug causing these icons to appear in other places. To access all of the other features of Pieces for VS Code, right click on a snippet.
When editing or previewing a snippet, Pieces for VS Code will display the name of the snippet as the file name instead of the unique asset ID. Hopefully, this makes your files easier to keep track of!
