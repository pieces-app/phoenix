# Pieces for JetBrains 3.3.3: Auto-Complete code from your personal snippets
> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:28:50 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Today marks a huge step forward in utilizing your saved snippets with the release of our new <strong>Code Auto-Complete feature</strong> in JetBrains. Instead of manually searching your snippets, Pieces intelligently suggests code completions from your personal Pieces repository as you type. To accept, just hit enter!
There are a handful of code auto-completion tools out in the wild, but we’re excited to be perhaps the first that is auto-completing from your personal snippets, not public snippets.

Together with our <strong>Auto-Save feature</strong> in Jetbrains — which automatically saves frequently used or useful snippets based on your behavior as you code — we’re excited to start to realize our vision of being the smartest, fastest AI Assistant for code snippets and screenshots.

Our internal devs have been using this feature a TON during testing by one-click saving a snippet from Chrome via the Pieces Chrome extension, and then immediately auto-completing the snippet in IntelliJ.
