We've got a jam-packed release today that includes a major OCR model upgrade for our popular text extraction from screenshots feature, major performance improvements and some bug fixes. Reach out to us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/getpieces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/getpieces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Chat</a> or support@pieces.app with questions or feedback.
## Pieces for Developers
<em>Pieces for Developers is the core user-facing Pieces application. Get started for free <a href="http://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em>

### Performance Improvements
- 66% increase in navigation speed as you browse through your snippets and screenshots.
- Image-to-text (OCR) has been super popular, and our ML team released v2 of the model with much faster and accurate processing.
- We upgraded the code editor for increased performance that paves the way for editing snippets in the future. Editing snippets in Pieces has been our most requested feature, and it&#x27;s almost here!

### Installing &amp; Configuring
- Better version handling between Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers - if one application is out of sync, users will be notified to update. This has been a point of friction for users, and we know the relationship between Pieces for Developers and Pieces OS can be confusing. Today&#x27;s improvement should help a lot.

### Managing Snippets
- [New Feature] Actions Menu - inspired by many modern tools like Superhuman, this is a simple, searchable menu where users can surface and trigger actions in the app. Just hit ⌘+return on MacOS or Ctrl+Enter on Windows to pull up the Actions menu.

- We made it easier to identify a new snippet by adding a “New” indicator in the bottom-right-hand corner of the code preview and in the Information View

### General Bug Fixes &amp; Enhancements
- Users identified a problem toggling between light and dark mode after onboarding. This is fixed!
- Our last update included a new way to search the language list when reclassifying a snippet. We made it simple to continue using keyboard shortcuts even when the search bar is in focus.

## Pieces API
<em>Everything we develop is on top of the Pieces API. We&#x27;re excited to welcome third-party developers who want to build applications on top of our infrastructure. Email us at support@pieces.app for more details.</em>

- Certain API endpoints now have an optional parameter, &quot;transferables&quot;, that enables a developer to specify whether or not to retrieve the whole value of a format or just the top-level meta data.
- This enables a developer to fetch format metadata immediately (transferables: false) and retrieve the value of a format after the fact as a way to increase performance (transferables: true).
[New Endpoints] Core endpoints around connecting to the cloud
- /clouds/connect
- /clouds/reconnect
- /clouds/disconnect
