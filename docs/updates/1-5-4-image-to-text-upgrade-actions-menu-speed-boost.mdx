> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:17:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

We've got a jam-packed release today that includes a major OCR model upgrade for our popular text extraction from screenshots feature, major performance improvements and some bug fixes.

## Pieces for Developers
**Pieces for Developers is the core user-facing Pieces application. Get started for free <a href="http://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.**

### Performance Improvements
- 66% increase in navigation speed as you browse through your snippets and screenshots.
- Image-to-text (OCR) has been super popular, and our ML team released v2 of the model with much faster and accurate processing.
- We upgraded the code editor for increased performance that paves the way for editing snippets in the future. Editing snippets in Pieces has been our most requested feature, and it's almost here!

### Installing & Configuring
- Better version handling between Pieces OS and Pieces for Developers - if one application is out of sync, users will be notified to update. This has been a point of friction for users, and we know the relationship between Pieces for Developers and Pieces OS can be confusing. Today's improvement should help a lot.

### Managing Snippets
- [New Feature] Actions Menu - inspired by many modern tools like Superhuman, this is a simple, searchable menu where users can surface and trigger actions in the app. Just hit ⌘+return on MacOS or Ctrl+Enter on Windows to pull up the Actions menu.

- We made it easier to identify a new snippet by adding a “New” indicator in the bottom-right-hand corner of the code preview and in the Information View

### General Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Users identified a problem toggling between light and dark mode after onboarding. This is fixed!
- Our last update included a new way to search the language list when reclassifying a snippet. We made it simple to continue using keyboard shortcuts even when the search bar is in focus.

## Pieces API
**Everything we develop is on top of the Pieces API. We're excited to welcome third-party developers who want to build applications on top of our infrastructure. Email us at support@pieces.app for more details.**

- Certain API endpoints now have an optional parameter, &quot;transferables&quot;, that enables a developer to specify whether or not to retrieve the whole value of a format or just the top-level meta data.
- This enables a developer to fetch format metadata immediately (transferables: false) and retrieve the value of a format after the fact as a way to increase performance (transferables: true).
[New Endpoints] Core endpoints around connecting to the cloud
- /clouds/connect
- /clouds/reconnect
- /clouds/disconnect
