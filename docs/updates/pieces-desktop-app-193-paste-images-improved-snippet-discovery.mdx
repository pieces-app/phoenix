# Pieces Desktop App 1.9.3: Paste images 🖼️ & improved Snippet Discovery
> Mon Mar 27 2023 17:40:57 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

As Pieces for Developers becomes a part of your everyday workflow, we know how important the small details are. In this release, you’ll find very helpful quality of life changes for saving images to Pieces and improvements to our recently introduced Snippet Discovery feature.

## Paste Images
Especially for Windows users, it’s important to be able to seamlessly paste images from your clipboard into the Pieces Desktop app. Now, you can! Paste images from around the web or the screenshots you take throughout your day directly into Pieces. As a reminder, you can drag & drop images, too!

## Improved Snippet Discovery
We’ve been blown away by the feedback from users on our new Snippet Discovery feature, where you can discover useful snippets from any file or directory.  One issue we found was around dependency folders such as node_modules, where we incurred some serious performance problems. What better way to fix this than to leverage <code>.gitignore</code> files?
With this update, Snippet Discovery will detect if a <code>.gitignore</code> file is present and use that to filter out unwanted files such as <code>build</code>, <code>dist</code>, <code>node_modules</code> and more. This way, the files in which we discover snippets are your actual working files.
We’d love to hear any feedback and/or constructive criticism you have about our Snippet Discovery feature, so give it a try and let us know <a href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

## General Bug Fixes & Improvements
Users were receiving survey dialogs multiple times in a short period of time. This should now be fixed, so you should only see them once. ✅
If you keep finding ‘em 🪲, we’ll keep crushing ‘em! There is no bug or flaw too small for us to address. If you see something, say something, and our team will make sure to take care of it as quickly as possible.
