## Workflow Activity - Seriously Enhanced Developer Productivity
Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the hardest elements of being a developer. With that in mind, we’re excited to release a second beta update of the “Workflow Activity” feature which launched at the end of 2022. With this update, Workflow Activity now makes it easier than ever to backtrack through your work in progress journey and access useful metadata associated with your saved snippets.
In addition to providing users insights to how they are using Pieces, Workflow Activity enables users to quickly find and access related links, shared snippets, associated tags, snippet collaborators, and other metadata that is connected to your saved materials.
We are really excited about how this new Workflow Activity View perfectly compliments the default Snippet Gallery View and beyond that, we are even more excited about doubling down on our goal to allow your workflow to resume without friction.

## Not sure what’s on your clipboard? Quickly check with the new Preview Before Paste 🫣
Copy and paste can lead to errors, especially when you’re working fast. Sometimes you captured an extra line or two, or you still have an old snippet, block of text, image or link copied. With Clipboard Preview, you can now see what is on your clipboard before you paste it into your Pieces Desktop App.
Simply hover over the “Paste” suggested action, and you will see the contents of your clipboard before you commit to creating a snippet.

## Smart Indentation ➡️ A new Suggested Quick Action: (Currently in Beta)
Sometimes when you’re copying a code snippet from a larger source file, the code snippet carries over extra indentation… this can be really annoying when trying to reference or reuse the snippet later on. We dropped in a new suggested quick action which helps you to tidy up this inconsistent indentation in a single click. In case our indent cleanup didn’t get it right, we made it super easy to revert the change.
