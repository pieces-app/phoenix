# Pieces for VS Code 0.1.15: Improved Onboarding Experience
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:54:08 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>We’re always trying to make Pieces easier to use and a more seamless part of your workflow. Making sure that all of our users, new and established, know how to use the app is a huge part of that. With this release, we’re launching an updated onboarding experience that shows you where to find your snippets, teaches you what you can do with them and more.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="A saved snippet notification in Pieces for VS Code." src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6319fa98e035981f57c86606_ScreenShot2022-09-06at5_56_30PM_9bc4655b3143408abe7a2fa8f8a76282_800.png" /></div></figure><h2 id="5f54f">Launch Pieces OS from VS Code</h2><p>In order for Pieces for VS Code to work properly, Pieces OS has to be running! But, it can be a bit of a challenge to figure out if Pieces OS is good to go. Now, if Pieces ever throws an error caused by Pieces OS not running, you can relaunch it from within VS Code.</p><p>You can also relaunch VS Code at the click of a button if you need to restart your IDE.</p><h2 id="fs2fh">Bug Fixes</h2><p>We’ve also crushed a number of pesky bugs in this release, including a bug in which copy + paste keyboard shortcuts would not function properly if Pieces OS wasn’t running.</p><h2 id="a1trq">Support</h2><p>As always, if you run into issues or have feedback, please fill out <a href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this quick form</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:support@pieces.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@pieces.app</a> and we’ll be in touch as soon as possible!</p>\n\n
