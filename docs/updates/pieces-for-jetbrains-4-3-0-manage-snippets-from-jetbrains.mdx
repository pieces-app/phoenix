# Pieces for JetBrains 4.3.0 - Manage snippets from JetBrains
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:46:17 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

This week’s JetBrains Suite release is deeply focused on improving usability, including a new tree view, drag and drop, snippet sharing and more.

## Tree view
Now, you can view a list of your saved snippets in a tree inside your editor. Snippets are grouped by language and listed according to the snippet’s name.

Being able to easily view and scan your snippets also enables a bunch of other really cool features, such as…

## Drag and drop snippets
Drag a snippet from the tree view and drop it exactly where you want it. No more right-clicks, copying and pasting or searching the Pieces desktop app for a specific snippet— just locate the snippet in the tree and drag it into your editor.

## Manage snippets right inside the JetBrains suite
We’ve also brought more useful functions from the Pieces desktop app directly into the JetBrains plugin. You can now share, rename, reclassify, delete and edit the descriptions of your snippets without leaving your editor.
