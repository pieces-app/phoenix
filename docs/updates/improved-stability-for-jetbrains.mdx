Today’s release of JetBrains 3.4.1 helps new and existing users better establish their connection to Pieces OS. If Pieces OS is not running, the app will auto-launch it. If Pieces OS is not installed, it will guide users to install it.

As a reminder, Pieces OS is the helper service that enables the JetBrains plugin to send and receive data 100% locally and securely on your machine. It is required for the plugin to function.

This release also included more detailed error and success notifications with better instructions for guiding users to success if an action failed.
