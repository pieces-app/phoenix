# 1.4.7: Improved search results, Suggestions API and more
> Mon Mar 27 2023 13:49:08 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Lots of useful improvements in today's release! Most importantly, this release marks the release of critical API infrastructure that will support upcoming user features around auto-saving snippets and other machine learning-driven suggestions. Pieces is about to get a whole lot smarter!
## Pieces for Developers
**Pieces for Developers is the core user-facing Pieces application.**

### Adding Pieces
- Windows users can now create a piece by dragging and dropping an entire code file
- Improved the overall drag and drop overlay

### Finding Pieces
- Added icons and hovers to indicate why a search result was returned, such as title match, description match, content match, multiple matches, or suggested match
- Resolved a focus issue for when a user clicks the icon carousel to unfocus search

### Viewing and Managing Pieces
- Users can now discover and add Integrations from within the Settings menu
- Smarter dismissal of notifications and menus when menus are open
- Increased support for more code languages and structures in the code preview

### Installing & Configuring Pieces
- Overhauled and improved onboarding experience for new users
- Users can refer-a-friend to Pieces through the Settings menu or by sharing <a href="http://pieces.app/invitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>
- Users can now move the Pieces window during onboarding and when menus are open

### Getting Support
- Users can now chat live with the Pieces team using the &quot;Chat Live&quot; action in the settings menu or on our <a href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/code.pieces.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>

## Pieces OS
**Pieces OS is the background service that enables Pieces to work locally and handles communications with any integrations you install. You can <a href="http://code.pieces.app/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install integrations here</a> that enable you to save and (soon) auto-save and auto-complete code snippets directly inside your favorite code editors and Chrome.**
- Fixed MacOS toolbar menu hovering issues

## Pieces API
**Pieces apps are built on the Pieces API. Email us at support@pieces.app if you're a developer interested in building on our API!**

### Image Support
- Expanded data model to support asset creation for images. Supporting mainly PNG, JPEG, PDF and TIFF to start

### OpenAPI Updates
- Updated required and optional properties for the following models - Asset, FlattenedAsset, Format and FlattenedFormat
- New Connector API Endpoint: /{application}/intention - an optional step in the new suggestion flow where developers can receive the origin of where the piece was copied. **For Example: you can call this on a copy event, where we will return a result that lets the developer know that the user copied this code snippet from the IntelliJ integration**
- New Connector API Endpoint: /{application}/suggestion - the main suggestion endpoint and the only required endpoint if a developer wants to use this for auto-uploading. **For Example: you can call this on a paste event, where we will return a result that lets the developer know that the Pieces system suggested to save this piece**
- New Connector API Endpoint: /{application}/reaction - another optional endpoint in the suggestion flow where a developer can choose to respond to the result of the suggested actions. **For example: if the developer wants the user to take some sort of confirmation action based on a suggestion, this is the endpoint to call to indicate the result of the action**
- New Mechanism enumeration added to Asset and FlattenedAsset to provide information about how the asset was saved. <strong>Manual</strong>: via user action, no auto-save. <strong>Automatic</strong>: via auto-save, no user action. <strong>Recommended</strong>: via auto-suggestion, requires user action [i.e. from /{application}/reaction]
- Renamed Timestamp model to GroupedTimestamp
- An API Endpoint to allow developers to delete data
