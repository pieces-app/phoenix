# 1.4.8: Suggested Save from JetBrains, one-click save from Chrome
> Mon Mar 27 2023 13:55:51 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

A couple of major feature releases today, with the theme of enabling you to save snippets in 1 second or less directly from your tools such as Chrome and IntelliJ.
More broadly, this marks the launch of Suggested Save, the first of several major machine learning-driven features to come. Look for a lot more work on deepening our functionality inside the tools you use all day as a developer.
## JetBrains Extension (including IntelliJ and PyCharm)

**Get the JetBrains Extension <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!**

### Saving a Piece
- Users can now enable Suggested Snippet Save, where Pieces identifies reuse patterns in your workflow in JetBrains and suggests snippets to be saved to Pieces.
- This is the first of many advanced, machine learning-driven features to come where Pieces will be proactively helpful for users.
- **To enable, go to Preferences &gt; Tools &gt; Pieces and click on Suggested Save.**

### Viewing and Reusing a Piece
- Users can view their saved pieces inside the JetBrains suite via the right-click menu or from the Tools menu.
- Users can insert a snippet from Pieces to their cursor position inside JetBrains via the right-click menu or from the Tools menu.
