# Web Extensions 2.1.1 - Customize your Browser Experience
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:49:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The Pieces Web Extensions are already super useful — automatic related links, anyone?— but what would make them even better? A settings menu. With today’s release, you can customize your browser experience more than ever before with settings for the Pieces Web Extension!

## Settings Menu
In the settings menu, you can:
- Choose the position of Pieces buttons on code blocks
- Set the minimum number of characters required for the Pieces buttons to detect a code block
- Add websites to your Filter Out list, so that the Pieces buttons won’t appear on websites you do not want them to

To access the settings menu, click the Pieces logo in your browser and select “Settings.” The menu will pop up in a new tab in your browser.

Coming soon: the ability to choose how which buttons you want to appear on code blocks, the ability to toggle between light mode and dark mode, and more!
