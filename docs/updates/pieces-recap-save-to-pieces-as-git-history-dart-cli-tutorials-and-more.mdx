# Pieces Recap: Save to Pieces As, Git History, Dart CLI tutorials and more
> Wed Jan 25 2023 14:31:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

It‚Äôs been a big month at Pieces, with five released updates to the Pieces for Developers Suite and nearly two dozen published articles, among other accomplishments. We wanted to take a moment to highlight our favorite Pieces features, a few of our top authors (and their articles) and other milestones that we hit in October.

Our engineering team has pushed a monster 5 releases this month! We‚Äôre particularly excited about two brand-new features that landed in our Plugins: ‚ÄúSave to Pieces As‚Äù in Pieces for JetBrains and auto-captured Git History snippet enrichment in Pieces for VS Code and Pieces for JetBrains.
<strong>Save to Pieces As</strong>

Just like the ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù you know and love, ‚ÄúSave to Pieces As‚Äù allows you to adjust a snippet‚Äôs auto-generated context before you save it. With pre-generated enrichment, including a title, tags, a description, related links, related people and more, it‚Äôs super simple to add a more descriptive title or remove an unnecessary tag.

<strong>Auto-captured Git History</strong>

Every developer uses Git‚Äî now Pieces leverages your Git history to add even more relevant context to your snippets. Starting this month, when you save a snippet from a Git-enabled repo, our IDE plugins auto-magically associate commit messages, commit authors, project and file names and more. Learn all about it in the <a href="https://code.pieces.app/updates/pieces-for-vs-code-0117-gitmore-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes.</a>
