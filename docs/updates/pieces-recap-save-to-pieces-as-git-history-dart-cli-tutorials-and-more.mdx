<p>It’s been a big month at Pieces, with five released updates to the Pieces for Developers Suite and nearly two dozen
    published articles, among other accomplishments. We wanted to take a moment to highlight our favorite Pieces
    features, a few of our top authors (and their articles) and other milestones that we hit in October. </p><h4

    <li>More than 2,000 people read our blog in October 📖</li>
</ol><h4 id="di26p">Features of the Month</h4><p>Our engineering team has pushed a monster 5 releases this month! We’re
    particularly excited about two brand-new features that landed in our Plugins: “Save to Pieces As” in Pieces for
    JetBrains and auto-captured Git History snippet enrichment in Pieces for VS Code and Pieces for JetBrains.</p><p>
    <strong>Save to Pieces As</strong></p><p>Just like the “Save As” you know and love, “Save to Pieces As” allows you
    to adjust a snippet’s auto-generated context before you save it. With pre-generated enrichment, including a title,
    tags, a description, related links, related people and more, it’s super simple to add a more descriptive title or
    remove an unnecessary tag. Read more about the feature <a

    history to add even more relevant context to your snippets. Starting this month, when you save a snippet from a
    Git-enabled repo, our IDE plugins auto-magically associate commit messages, commit authors, project and file names
    and more. Learn all about it in the <a
