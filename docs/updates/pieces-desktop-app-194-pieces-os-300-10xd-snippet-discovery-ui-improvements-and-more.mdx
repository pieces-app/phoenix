## Activity View is almost here

Be one of the first to use it by joining our <a href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/XGGlUqEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beta Testing Community</a>.

## Easily Access Shareable Links
You can now access your shareable links via the Context View and via the Quick Menu. Simply tap CMD+L to generate a shareable link and CMD+I to see it in the Context View.
