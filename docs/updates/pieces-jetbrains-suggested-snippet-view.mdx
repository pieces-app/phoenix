# Pieces for JetBrains 4.9.0: Suggested View, OCR Support & More ðŸ”¥
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:24:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The demands on developers increase every day. As a result, a developer's time is  ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have. With that, our team has invested serious resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
We're excited for you to check out Suggested Materials View, available now in Pieces for JetBrains! This view is based on your recently saved materials, but will evolve over time.
This release also includes full support for our OCR in the JetBrains plugin, a totally reimagined JetBrains Marketplace Listing, support for IntelliJâ€™s UI Beta, and a number of fixes for pesky bugs. Check it out!

## Suggested View
Similar to the Pieces Desktop Appâ€™s &quot;Filter by suggested&quot; view, The Pieces for JetBrains Suggested Snippet List View returns a list of existing snippets that are perceived as relevant to the user's current flow.
The suggested snippet view does not suggest new snippets, but instead resurfaces relevant snippets that were already saved to Pieces for Developers.
Inserting or modifying a snippet from the Suggested Materials view works in the same way as from the List View. Just use a handy <a href="https://zeep.pieces.cloud/?p=f71c48b7ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keyboard shortcut</a> or Drag and Drop.

## OCR Support
Extracting code from images and screenshots with our specialized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is one of the most useful features of the Pieces Desktop App. Now, you can utilize OCR in the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, too! Modify an imageâ€™s metadata, copy the extracted code from the Markdown preview, and more, directly in your JetBrains IDE.
