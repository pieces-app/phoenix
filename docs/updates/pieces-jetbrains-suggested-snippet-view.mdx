# Pieces for JetBrains 4.9.0: Suggested View, OCR Support & More 🔥
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:24:36 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>The demands on developers increase every day. As a result, a developer&#x27;s time is ever more precious and anything
    that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have. With that, our team has invested serious
    resources into enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right
    time.</p><p>We&#x27;re excited for you to check out Suggested Materials View, available now in Pieces for JetBrains!
    This view is based on your recently saved materials, but will evolve over time.</p><p>This release also includes
    full support for our OCR in the JetBrains plugin, a totally reimagined JetBrains Marketplace Listing, support for
    IntelliJ’s UI Beta, and a number of fixes for pesky bugs. Check it out!</p><h2 id="d5e9p">Suggested View</h2>
<p>Similar to the Pieces Desktop App’s &quot;Filter by suggested&quot; view, The Pieces for JetBrains Suggested Snippet
    List View returns a list of existing snippets that are perceived as relevant to the user&#x27;s current flow.</p>
<p>The suggested snippet view does not suggest new snippets, but instead resurfaces relevant snippets that were already
    saved to Pieces for Developers.</p><p>Inserting or modifying a snippet from the Suggested Materials view works in
    the same way as from the List View. Just use a handy <a href="https://zeep.pieces.cloud/?p=f71c48b7ff"

    Character Recognition (OCR) is one of the most useful features of the Pieces Desktop App. Now, you can utilize OCR
    in the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, too! Modify an image’s metadata, copy the extracted code from the Markdown
    preview, and more, directly in your JetBrains IDE.</p><figure
