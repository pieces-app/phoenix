# Pieces Web Extensions 2.2.0: Upgraded Settings Menu
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:55:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>The Pieces web extensions are having a moment— did you see that we just got verified on the Chrome Web Store? We’re
    keeping that momentum rolling with better code detection, a new and improved settings menu and groundwork for new
    features.</p><p>Go update your extension right now! You don’t want to miss this release.</p><h2 id="b0n6d">Settings
    upgrade</h2><p>It wasn’t too long ago that we introduced Settings to our Web Extensions— the first version is now
    getting an upgrade. Instead of opening a new tab to customize your experience, you can toggle to dark mode or move
    your buttons to the top right of a code block from the popover menu.</p><figure

    introducing a new method of recursively searching a webpage with all of the ways that we know how to identify code.
    You’ll notice that buttons appear more consistently across websites!</p><p>We’ve also laid the groundwork for the
    next big feature on our roadmap: auto-suggesting snippets. Starting today, we’ll help you to retrace your steps from
    query to snippet by capturing additional related links. In the future, this algorithm will help us to auto-save
    useful snippets from the web.</p><h2 id="bj6r7">Support</h2><p>As always, if you run into issues or have feedback,
