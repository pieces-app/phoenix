# Pieces Web Extensions 2.2.0: Upgraded Settings Menu
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:55:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The Pieces web extensions are having a moment— did you see that we just got verified on the Chrome Web Store? We’re keeping that momentum rolling with better code detection, a new and improved settings menu and groundwork for new features.
Go update your extension right now! You don’t want to miss this release.

## Settings upgrade
It wasn’t too long ago that we introduced Settings to our Web Extensions— the first version is now getting an upgrade. Instead of opening a new tab to customize your experience, you can toggle to dark mode or move your buttons to the top right of a code block from the popover menu.

## Code block identification improvements
To improve code block identification, we’re introducing a new method of recursively searching a webpage with all of the ways that we know how to identify code. You’ll notice that buttons appear more consistently across websites!
We’ve also laid the groundwork for the next big feature on our roadmap: auto-suggesting snippets. Starting today, we’ll help you to retrace your steps from query to snippet by capturing  additional related links. In the future, this algorithm will help us to auto-save useful snippets from the web.
