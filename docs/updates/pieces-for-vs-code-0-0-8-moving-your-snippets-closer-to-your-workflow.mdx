# Pieces for VS Code 0.0.8 - Moving your snippets closer to your workflow
> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:09:06 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

We’re excited to launch a major release for Pieces for VS Code today.
One of our product principles has always been to <strong>keep developers in their flow</strong>, and today’s release is a big step forward where developers can see their saved snippets directly inside VS Code in a new Tree View.
Check out all the updates below, and look for the little sneak peak of what’s in our next big VS Code release - auto-complete!

## Visual Studio Code Extension
<em>Get the Pieces VSCode Extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em>

### Saving Snippets
- In addition to right-clicking or using keyboard shortcuts to save a snippet, users can now run the “Save to Pieces” command prompt.

### Viewing Snippets inside VS Code
- View your saved snippets inside VS Code via a Tree View in the sidebar! (You can always toggle to Pieces app for a more robust, dedicated snippet viewing and managing experience.)
- To preview the contents of a snippet, simply hover your cursor over the name of the snippet.
- Snippets in the VS Code Tree View are auto-organized by language
- Refresh the list of snippets in the Tree View by clicking on the “Refresh” button in the upper right-hand corner of the Tree View.

### Re-Using Snippets
- To insert a saved snippet, click on the desired snippet in the Tree View and it will be inserted into your cursor location in your editor

### Coming Soon: Auto-Complete Code in VS Code
- Pieces will suggest code completions right in VS Code from your saved snippets in Pieces. Not from public repos like other auto-complete tools - Pieces auto-completes from YOUR private Pieces repo. Your code never leaves your machine.
