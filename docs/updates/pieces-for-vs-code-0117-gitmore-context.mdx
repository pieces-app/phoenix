We’re dropping a crazy new release today! Any snippet you create in VS Code now automatically includes extra-helpful context from your Git history, like code authors, commit messages, files, projects and more— in addition to all of the other context Pieces captures! There’s also a cool new section of the Pieces Explorer where you can learn more about the Pieces Suite and some minor quality of life improvements.

## Auto-magic context from GitHub
Do you use GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab? Of course you do! They provide <strong>so much</strong> useful context for your code— what if that context was automatically captured in Pieces?

Now it is. When you save a snippet from code that has been in a Git repo, Pieces auto-magically associates commit messages, commit authors, project and file names and more. (Choose which context you want to capture in the Pieces for VS Code settings!)

No need to search through your entire repo for the full context of a snippet! Pieces saves all of the GitHub context in addition to the metadata we already capture. All of it is fully editable, saved locally and easy to share. It’s like magic.

## New Pieces Explorer Section
There’s a new section of your Pieces Explorer in town: “About”
Along with “Saved Pieces” and “Connect,” you can easily navigate to “About” to quickly access the Pieces Support Center, discover other Pieces products or connect with the Pieces community. Try it out!

## Auto-complete
We hear you! Sometimes auto-complete in VS Code can interrupt your flow. That’s the last thing we want, so we’ve switched auto-complete to be off by default. If you’d like to use it, just turn it on in the Pieces settings in VS Code.
