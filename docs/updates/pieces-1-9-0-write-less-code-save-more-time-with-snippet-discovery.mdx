# Pieces 1.9.0: Write less code, save more time with Snippet Discovery
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:59:21 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Introducing Snippet Discovery— the fastest, easiest way to discover and save useful snippets from your own code. Snippet Discovery scans a given file or directory and finds the code snippets that you use frequently, enabling you to save them to Pieces. Even better, your saved snippets are upgraded to include smart tags, descriptions and more.

Discovering snippets in your existing code has huge benefits, including:
- Standardizing your code within and across projects
- Less time spent re-writing the same code over and over
- Quickly and easily sharing standard snippets among your team

## Bug fixes & performance improvements
- If you use Pieces while connected to an account, some parts of the app used to malfunction if you lost internet connection. Not anymore— this is also fixed.
Pieces OS is instrumental to the entire Pieces suite; this week, we:
- Added Relationships Architecture and two new endpoints
- Deprecated .ext from the Format Model, so the sole source of truth is our ClassificationSpecificEnum
- Fixed some small bugs
