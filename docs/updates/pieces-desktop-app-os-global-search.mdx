# Pieces for Developers 1.12.0 & Pieces OS 4.1.0: Global Search, A Faster Way to Find Developer Materials ⚡🌎
> Mon Mar 27 2023 20:31:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

We are thrilled to announce the release of two exciting features in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App. First, Global Search 🌎, an innovative new way to find materials in Pieces that sets the stage for even more advanced search capabilities in the future. Using natural language queries and a minimalist UI, Global Search makes it easy to find the materials you need in record time. Second, we’re introducing Productivity Scores 💯; a new way to gauge the usefulness of a snippet. With higher scores indicating greater usefulness, Productivity Scores are a powerful tool for boosting your productivity and getting more value out of the materials you save to Pieces.

## Effortlessly Find Materials with Global Search 🌎
We’re super excited to release the first version of an entirely new way to find materials in Pieces: Global Search. This sets the stage for exciting future search capabilities 🔍, allowing you to solve problems faster and find the materials you need quickly and easily with natural language. With its intuitive interface and lighting-fast ⚡ results, Global Search is sure to become an essential tool in your workflow. Try it out by selecting &quot;Global Search&quot; from the navigation dropdown next to the search bar.

## Productivity Scores 💯
In Global Search, you’ll notice that each material is labeled with a Productivity Score. This is a unique way to get an approximation of how useful a snippet is for you— the higher the score, the better!

Productivity Scores will go up the more you reference, copy, share, or manage your materials in Pieces. We have a lot more in store for the Productivity Score feature, including generating an approximate time savings. Keep an eye out for more in the coming weeks.
