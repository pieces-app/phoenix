# 1.5.8: Improved snippet editing & UX enhancements
> Mon Mar 27 2023 14:36:14 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Today's release is packed with incremental improvements to Pieces for Developers and the Pieces Chrome Extension. With improvements to snippet editing, troubleshooting and onboarding, we're ensuring that your experience with Pieces is as seamless as possible.
## Pieces for Developers
**Get started for free <a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> For the best experience, please make sure both Pieces for Developers and Pieces OS are up-to-date.**

### Snippet Editing
Thank you to all of our users for your feedback on snippet editing following last week's launch! We're making continuous improvements to make sure that it's as useful a feature as possible.
- To make editing your snippets more intuitive, the cursor will now automatically appear and focus when toggling into edit mode.
- Once you've begun editing a snippet, you can now click outside the editor in order to save or discard your changes.

### Error Handling
- Made some updates to the error screens, so that when something goes wrong with Pieces for Developers or Pieces OS, you can more easily tell if Pieces needs an update or if you should contact our support.

### Bug Fixes
- Solved an issue where APP_NAME appeared when right-clicking the dock icon on MacOS - now it says Pieces for Developers!
