# VS Code 0.1.8: Snippet editing and snippet imports
> **Published by the Pieces Team** | May 1st, 2023

Our ultimate goal is to make Pieces as useful and seamless as possible to your life as a developer. That means intelligent features and workflow shortcuts that don’t require more work for you. In this release, we’re launching snippet editing directly in VS Code (no need to open Pieces for Developers), importing your local User Snippets all at once and more. Cheers to keeping you in your flow!

## Import your user snippets to Pieces
This is our first feature that allows you to import existing snippets, but definitely not our last! If you have snippets saved locally in VS Code’s User Snippets, now you can import them to Pieces. Simply open the Pieces settings (Code &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings &gt; Pieces) and click “Add User Snippets to Pieces.” All of your snippets will be instantly ready for use.

## Edit your snippets in VS Code
We recently launched one of our most-requested features: the ability to edit your snippets in Pieces for Developers. Today, you can edit your snippets without leaving VS Code — no need to open Pieces for Developers at all!
To edit, right-click the snippet and select “Edit.” Once you’ve finished editing, save the file, and your updated snippet is ready to go.

## New options in tree view
All of your snippets are categorized by language in the tree view. This update allows you to choose if you’d like to see the title, the description or a preview of the snippet in your tree.

## Toggle Auto-Save on/off
In our last release, we launched auto-save, where the Pieces AI Assistant intelligently saves snippets on your behalf based on your workflow. In this release, we’ve included the ability to toggle auto-save on and off in your Pieces settings in VS Code.

## Updated onboarding
We’ve updated our onboarding experience so that new users can more easily install Pieces, save their first piece and learn about useful features.
