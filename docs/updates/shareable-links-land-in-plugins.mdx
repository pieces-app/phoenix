# Shareable links land in plugins
> Mon Mar 27 2023 15:24:31 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>We’ve gotten fantastic feedback from users since <a
    href="https://updates.pieces.app/announcements/1-6-0-share-snippets-with-one-click" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">last week’s mega release of one-click Snippet Sharing</a> from the Pieces desktop app!</p>
<p>We’re not surprised - devs share snippets constantly, but most tools like Slack or Discord struggle to present and
    index code as code for readers. Sharing snippets via Pieces couldn’t be easier, and recipients benefit from improved
    formatting, syntax highlighting, tags and related links, which means your recipients receive both the code AND the
    context around that code.</p><p>Today’s releases for VS Code and JetBrains bring the power of single-click snippet
    sharing to your editor! Now you can highlight any code in your editor, right-click to generate a Pieces shareable
    link and share anywhere, all without even having the Pieces desktop app open! Your recipients get all that context
    right alongside the code - including the file name, the line numbers and auto-generated tags.</p><p>Update or
    install the latest Pieces for VS Code and Pieces for JetBrains plugins to up your code sharing game today!</p><h2
    id="22aoc">Shareable links</h2><p>Create shareable links — with just one click! — directly in VS Code and JetBrains.
    Just highlight your code, right-click and select “Share via Pieces Link.” Depending on your preferences, the link
    will either be automatically copied to your clipboard or you can click to copy it yourself.</p><figure

</figure><p>In VS Code, you can also generate a link for a saved snippet in tree view by right-clicking and selecting
    “Share via Pieces Link.”</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"

</figure><p>Just like the snippets you’ve shared from Pieces for Developers, recipients instantly save the snippet to
    their Pieces library, and shared snippets preserve their formatting, syntax highlighting, tags and related links, so
    you can share the code and its context.</p><p><em>Note: In order to generate sharable links, you must have Pieces OS
    and Pieces for Developers, and you must be connected to the cloud.</em></p><h2 id="20pkv">Connect to the Cloud from
    VS Code</h2><p>You can now log into your account and connect to the cloud from the sidebar in VS Code. No need to
    open the VS Code settings or Pieces for Developers to make sure that you’re properly connected— just check “Connect”
    in your sidebar.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image"
